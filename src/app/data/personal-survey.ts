		'The type of time together that appears to be the most nurturing to a healthy relationship has at least three main ingredients. The first is simple time. Real, dedicated, sprawling, unhurried time. The second is genuine loving attention. Genuine attention involves looking deeply with fresh eyes and listening closely with an open heart. Time to really see each other, time to be genuinely curious about each other, time to be continually getting to know each other. Finally, the third ingredient is non-judgmental, openhearted presence. This is not the time to find and solve problems. It is not the time to work on changing each other. It is simply time to spend enjoying each other’s company.  John Gottman, a leading couple’s researcher, has found that this intimacy sustaining time can take as little as five minutes here and there throughout the day.  He talks about creating and maintaining what he calls “Love maps” by spending a little bit of genuinely attentive time at the beginning of the day being actively curious about what is going on in your partner’s life that day so you can carry a loving thought of them throughout the day.  Then again at the end of the day, he recommends spending another, possibly brief, time being curious about how your partner’s day unfolded. Although these shared moments do not have to be lengthy, they must involve your full-hearted and non-judgmental attention.  Of course, it is also recommended that healthy couples also spend some regular time together that feels more leisurely, perhaps weekly.',
		'Like you, many couples today are finding that they have less and less time to spend genuinely nurturing their relationship with each other. The demands of work, family, community, and home unite to fill every available moment and partners easily give in and put their relationship on the back burner while they attend to all the other pressing demands on their time. Time together, however, while it seems almost too simple, is the most basic ingredient of a healthy intimate relationship. It is becoming more and more clear that a relationship is a living being and that, as such, it requires regular care and feeding. Perhaps the most basic form of that regular care and feeding is real time spent being lovingly attentive to each other. You can starve a relationship of time for short periods and it will survive on its own stored resources. Eventually, however, even the strongest of relationships will simply starve to death. It just cannot be emphasized strongly enough how vitally important it is for partners to spend real time together.  The type of time together that appears to be the most nurturing to a healthy intimate relationship has at least three main ingredients. The first is simple time. Real, dedicated, sprawling, unhurried time. The second is genuine loving attention. Genuine attention involves looking deeply with fresh eyes and listening closely with an open heart.

		'One area that can at times be challenging for you is communicating and displaying your emotions in healthy ways. Although you and your partner clearly care deeply about each other and would like to be able to communicate in emotionally supportive ways, this is an area of your relationship that you would like to improve.  Research has shown that perhaps the most destructive things that couples do are (1) criticize, (2) communicate contempt, (3) become overly defensive, and (4) prematurely withdraw from conversation. It is important to note that “withdraw” does not necessarily mean leaving, but can mean “taking a step back” emotionally because the topic seems like an invitation to unhealthy conflict or because the interaction has become emotionally flooding.  Oftentimes, our families do not provide good resources for learning a repertoire to deal with anger in an emotionally healthy way. Styles of communicating emotions are deeply embedded and often learned in our childhood environments, so when one partner has a noticeably different style it is very easy to see that style as “wrong” because it feels wrong given our own deeply held perspective.                                                                      The communication dynamics operating within your relationship can be much like dancing a waltz.  You will inevitably step on each other’s toes from time to time and if you don’t communicate about the times you step on each other’s toes, you are inevitably going to keep stepping on each other’s toes.  This cycle of stepping on each other’s toes inevitably leads to toes getting sore, and the next slightest misstep can spark an emotional blowup. The key to dancing more gracefully is regular communication about both the graceful moments and the occasional missteps. Saying “you know that hurts my feelings” although challenging in the short run, can avoid the every-6-month blowup. The problem with the 6-month blowup is that it can be so emotionally dramatic that you become less likely to give each other feedback in the moment for fear of triggering another dramatic blowup. By giving each other regular feedback about both the good moments and the occasional missteps, you will learn how to dance more gracefully together on a day-to-day basis and will make the every six-month blowup less and less likely.   We know that when couples use open and constructive communication skills, each partner feels:  (a) safe to express his/her thoughts and feelings; (b) heard and understood while communicating; (c) safe to talk about what they need and to problem solve about how to meet those needs in healthy ways; and (d) intimate and connected emotionally.  Ideally, when couples are functioning at an optimal level, each individual feels supported, validated, accepted and respected for his/her individuality and unique contribution to the relationship.',
		'It can be difficult to make up after fights, especially when it comes to reoccurring topics of disagreement within a couple’s relationship. Although practically no one likes to stay mad at each other, making up can sometimes imply concessions or apologies that partners feel unwilling to make. It may also be difficult for partners to “cool down” after becoming engaged in a heated discussion.  Partners will sometimes hold a grudge after the conflict, rather than reaching a resolution and letting go of the problem. Some couples describe the tendency to “bring the argument to bed with them” rather than trying to work through the issue. Although partners may benefit from a cool down period before beginning to approach the topic again, it is important to not let these touchy subjects linger. This pattern of leaving issues unresolved can leave both partners feeling as though their feelings have not been understood and valued by the other partner. Each partner may also feel hostile and may hold on to the negative feelings surrounding the argument rather than letting them go.  It is important to recognize that what one partner sees is not always an accurate reflection of what the other partner feels. For example, underneath actions like cutting remarks, may be softer emotions like fear of being vulnerable or hurt. Sometimes partners feel hurt, sad, lonely and vulnerable, and instead of looking to their partner for soothing, they lean in the direction of putting up a wall and trying to protect themselves with emotions like anger, resentment, and bitterness.  Couples research shows that the way in which a couple fights can greatly affect their long-term relationship satisfaction. It is important to end disagreements with some element of closure, whether it be a compromise and solution or simply an agreement to continue discussing the issue at another point in time. If both partners acknowledge that the issue is there and has yet to be resolved, than, at the very least, neither partner feels that their feelings are being devalued or dismissed.   Couples may feel that they do not communicate well in the heat of an argument, but if they practice talking to each other calmly and respectfully around sensitive topics, they will be able to improve their ability to communicate when they argue in the future. This may also help them to feel like they are back on the same team in a more timely manner.',
		'In many couples, the tone of a discussion or argument is set by the way in which the issue is raised. This can turn out well, if the issue is brought up in a thoughtful, collaborative way, but can also go poorly if the issue is presented with anger, blame, or criticism.  Raising issues in a certain way can tell you a lot about a partner’s personal communication style. Styles of communicating are often a stable part of our personalities, so when one partner has a noticeably different style it is very easy to see that style as “wrong” because it feels wrong given our own deeply held perspective. It is important to note that all couples have their naturally occurring differences and all partners have facets that the other struggles to accept. The healthiest couples have found ways to cope well with these differences and to accept each other for these “natural flaws in their fabric.”  Research has shown that there are four types of “filters” that can affect couples as they struggle for clear communication:  1) emotional states, 2) beliefs and expectations, and 3) differences in style and 4) inattention. It may be useful to keep these in mind as you consider when and how to raise difficult issues.  The communication dynamics operating within your relationship can be much like dancing a waltz.  You will inevitably step on each other’s toes from time to time and if you don’t communicate about the times you step on each other’s toes, you are inevitably going to keep stepping on each other’s toes.  This cycle of stepping on each other’s toes inevitably leads to toes getting sore, and the next slightest misstep can spark an emotional blowup.  The key to dancing more gracefully is regular communication about both the graceful moments and the occasional missteps. By giving each other regular feedback about both the good moments and the occasional missteps, you will learn how to dance more gracefully together on a day-to-day basis and will reduce the chances of bringing up a constant issue in a hostile, confrontational way.',
		'Couples research has shown that the most resilient couples are those that are best able to repair their emotional connection after conflicts, both big and small. Furthermore, there is a growing research literature on the role of forgiveness in relationship health showing that a capacity for forgiveness is an essential part of long-term health and resilience.  Forgiveness has been defined as a decision to give up your perceived or actual right to get even with, or hold in debt, someone who has wronged you. Forgiveness does not excuse the person of responsibility for his or her actions; it does however seek to re-establish what was before the infraction. David and Claudia Arp, coauthors of “Fighting for Your Empty Nest Marriage,” emphasize the importance of a deep, abiding attitude of forgiveness that permeates a relationship. Given that no one is perfect, relationships need a daily dose of true forgiveness. Research suggests that the kind of forgiveness that lasts is that which is motivated by your desire to enhance the well being of your partner, rather than for your own personal benefit.',
		'Research on the development of couples’ relationships over time has shown that the decrease in satisfaction with sexual relationships that many couples experience is not uncommon over the course of an intimate relationship. And yet, when this distance in intimacy occurs, couples can find themselves in somewhat uncharted territory. It is in this spot that we encourage partners to enter these waters with love and curiosity. Oftentimes one partner may feel the need for more independent space and less physical contact, which can lead the other partner to feel a fundamental and deep missing of the vital sexual connection that they once had. In these places of intense yearning couples can often go quiet about their experiences and needs, and it is essential that they turn back towards each other and find ways to express themselves in order to find pathways back to one another in the realm of sensuality and physical connection.    It is often the case that couples inadvertently fall into a cognitive emotional pattern in which they begin framing their sexual relationship as a puzzle to be solved in the service of an idealized goal. Goal directed problem solving in an intimate sexual relationship can frequently obscure the moment-to-moment, real, flesh and blood, erotic journey of each new and unique sexual moment between partners. The recommendation, to the extent that it is possible, is for partners to hold lightly any expectations that they have in the form of a sexual ideal and instead to enter each moment of sexual connection as a journey into new, unknown, and exciting territory. This may take some practice in staying open, flexible, and lovingly present.    Some couples think about sex in a way that has a performance anxiety producing frame. A lot of couples get caught in that spot where sex is about performance and outcome so the process gets lost. It is important to re-invite that quality of relating and experiencing into the relationship. Each sexual encounter is a sensual journey without a map. Pay close and loving attention to the territory and simply keep moving forward with an attitude of savoring and generosity. Then whatever happens while you are making love is exactly right and fundamentally perfect.   It is also important to communicate openly about your physical relationship in ways that protect and enhance the sexual aspects of your relationship. Unless you feel safe and take emotional risks sharing your feelings with each other, your relationship will not be as intimate as it can be. While this involves taking risks and can be difficult, expressing wants, needs, and desires opens the door for intimacy.',
		'Although you and your partner clearly care deeply for each other and want to understand each other well, you have indicated that acceptance of each other’s naturally occurring differences can sometimes be an issue in your relationship. It is important to note that all couples have their naturally occurring differences and all partners have facets that the other struggles to accept.    Studies suggest that partners who are better able to accept each other “warts and all” are happiest in the short run and most resilient in the long run. All of us want to be accepted for who we are, particularly for those parts of ourselves that we know are challenging to live with. One of the things that characterizes a truly loving relationship is partners’ willingness to tolerate or even embrace each other’s challenging bits. We are all challenging to live with in our own unique way.  The healthiest couples have found ways to cope well with their naturally occurring differences and to accept each other for the “natural flaws in their fabric.” One of the things we’ve noticed is that the harder partners push each other for change, the more stuck they can become. Pressure creates resistance and resistance creates pressure in a vicious cycle.    In approaching this issue, you and your partner may find it useful to support each other’s individuality and unique contributions to the relationship, rather than moving towards changing each other. Allow your partner their quirks, anxieties, irrationalities, and foibles. That is the way you and your partner will feel most loved.',
		'Unless couples feel safe and take emotional risks sharing their feelings with each other, their relationship will not be all it can be. While this involves taking a risk and is often very difficult, expressing wants, needs, and desires opens the door to intimacy and to really knowing each other.  Over the course of a relationship, as a product of growing closer and knowing each other more fully, it is inevitable that partners will hurt each other’s feelings. This can be quite similar to learning how to dance, since as a product of learning how to work with each other and accept each other’s unique nature, it is inevitable that partners will step on each other’s toes. It is important for partners to be determined not to be deterred by difficulties on the dance floor, and to try their best to come together as quickly as possible after any stumbling or awkwardness.   Many couples today are finding that they have less and less time to spend genuinely nurturing their relationship with each other. The demands of work, family, community, and home unite to fill every available moment and partners easily give in and put their relationship on the back burner while they attend to all the other pressing demands on their time. This pattern may leave partners feeling like they are growing more and more distant from each other, and may eventually leave them feeling like they no longer even know each other.   The literature suggests that it is important to the overall health of a relationship for partners to listen empathically to each other even when they disagree. It is important to understand that something is a big deal to your partner, even if you don’t entirely understand why it is a big deal. Many times it is more important to us to feel that our partner understands that something really matters to us, even if he or she can’t care in quite the same way about it. Often, feeling appreciated and understood is an aspect of the relationship that becomes lacking due to partners’ differing styles of expressing their love for one another. Being compassionate towards one another, despite these natural flaws in the fabric, can allow for couples to feel known and intimately connected in their relationships, rather than unheard and disconnected.  Research suggests that the deepest kind of intimacy develops when one partner shares something he or she feels vulnerable about and the other partner responds in a positive, understanding, and accepting manner. That response of warm acceptance does something very powerful to a relationship. Safety leads partners to feel more intimacy, which then snowballs into more sharing and more intimacy. Fearing to take these kinds of risks in your relationship can be a worrisome sign of distance between partners. To stay deeply attached, partners need to maintain the ability to share intimately. Like playing a piano, intimacy is a skill that can be practiced. As each partner takes risks to try making vulnerable statements, the cyclical quality becomes to their advantage, and back and forth positive expressions begin to come naturally.  It is quite common for a fear of vulnerability to exist after a period of distress. What can become somewhat problematic in this space is when couples’ way of coping with and communicating about this fear of vulnerability ends up leaving them questioning and doubting themselves, which can push them into opposing corners of silence and leave both of them feeling lonelier or less understood than they would like.',
		'One issue that is often problematic for couples is lack of verbally affectionate communication. Often partners have tried to hint or actually asked for compliments and more positive statements of love, and have been refused or had their request go unanswered. On the other side of this, some partners are uncomfortable and unfamiliar with high levels of verbal affection, and may not understand their importance to others.   A lack of affectionate communication in couples is not unusual.  However, what can make this issue particularly destructive is the cumulative quality of it. Harsh or unkind communication from one partner prompts the other to respond in kind, and the cycle continues. The resulting negative tone of their communication grows larger and larger, leaving less and less room for loving or complimentary expressions. Like playing an instrument, affectionate communication is a skill that can be practiced. As each partner takes risks to try making loving statements, the cumulative quality becomes to their advantage, and reciprocal positive expressions begin to come naturally.  Furthermore, styles of communicating emotions are deeply embedded, so when you have a noticeably different style it is very easy to see that style as “wrong” because it feels wrong given our own deeply held perspective.  Sometimes, you will be accustomed to being verbally affectionate, while your partner has never really employed that sort of communication before.  This difference in perspective about how to communicate emotions can lead partners to feel underappreciated and emotionally distant from one another. It is important to note that all couples have their naturally occurring differences and all partners have facets that the other struggles to accept.  The healthiest couples have found ways to cope well with these differences and to accept each other for the “natural flaws in their fabric.”  In approaching this issue, couples may find it useful to support each other’s individuality and unique contributions to the relationship, rather than focusing on changing each other’s communication styles.    For some couples, a lack of verbal affection seems to be closely related to the time they spend together. Many couples today are finding that they have less and less time to spend genuinely nurturing their relationship with each other. Although couples often desire to be more verbally affectionate, the demands of work, family, community, and home leave them so busy and/or tired that they have to put their relationship on the back burner while they attend to all the other pressing demands on their time.   In addition, it is important to recognize that what one partner sees is not always an accurate reflection of what the other partner feels. For example, underneath actions like yelling or shouting insults, may be softer emotions like fear of being vulnerable or deep hurt. Sometimes partners feel hurt, sad, or lonely, and instead of asking your partner for kind words or understanding, you lean in the direction of putting up a wall and trying to protect yourself with emotions like anger, resentment and bitterness. Once you begin to recognize these underlying emotions, and attend to them, you can begin to repair and move toward each other in a loving manner.',
		'Many couples wish that they could be more physically affectionate with each other, but are held back for a variety of reasons including upbringing, level of desired closeness, or simple lack of time to spend together.   This issue of physical affection merges, to some degree, with the sharing of time and pleasure with one another. There is of course a reciprocal relationship between all of these things—spending time together in pleasurable activities tends to increase sense of connection and intimacy as well as the desire for physical closeness, and physical closeness in turn feeds emotional intimacy. All of these components have been shown by research to be fundamental to a healthy long-term intimate relationship.    Couples often talk about how their families were not physically affectionate, and how that way of interacting with other people is still influencing them currently. For some partners, the issue of physical affection is more centered around the desired level of closeness or intimacy. Often, one partner wants to be more physically affectionate on a regular basis, while the other partner prefers to be more distant, or at least less close when in public.   For some couples, the lack of physical affection seems to be closely related to the time they spend together. Many couples today are finding that they have less and less time to spend genuinely nurturing their relationship with each other. Although couples often desire to be more affectionate, the demands of work, family, community, and home unite to fill every available moment and partners easily give in and put their relationship on the back burner while they attend to all the other pressing demands on their time. However, time together, while it seems almost too simple, is the most basic ingredient of a healthy intimate relationship. It simply cannot be emphasized strongly enough how vitally important it is for partners to spend real time together. Many couples have found that consciously and actively setting aside regular time for being close, both emotionally and physically, is of great benefit and often becomes the sort of emotional haven that both partners look forward to during the rest of the week. It should be noted that such times do not always have to involve sex, as long as partners spend that time paying attention to each other and being affectionate.',
		'The research suggests that self-disclosure is an important aspect of healthy relationships. Although expressing oneself in this manner can be uncomfortable, effectively expressing wants and needs can be used as a tool to bring you closer together as partners and as friends. Another area that can sometimes be problematic for couples is effectively communicating their wants and needs. It seems like some partners struggle to find the balance between acknowledging their personal wants and needs, and a deeply ingrained value to be selfless or self-sufficeint.  The best type of communication between partner’s results in both partners feeling like the other person really understands where they are coming from, even if they don’t necessarily agree. The literature suggests that it is important to the overall health of a relationship for partners to listen empathically to each other even when you disagree. Understanding that something is big deal to your partner, even if you don’t entirely understand why it is a big deal can make a big difference. Many times it is more important to us to feel that our partner understands that something really matters to us, even if he or she can’t care in quite the same way about it.  Sometimes, the issue of effectively expressing wants and needs can be understood as a difference along the social extrovert versus social introvert continuum. The personality literature has found that this continuum is perhaps the most basic along which people differ. While most partners are likely not examples of the extreme ends of this continuum, they can be just different enough for that difference to create a naturally occurring friction point between them. If you are unaware of this theme, it has more control over the direction of your relationship. To the degree that you are aware of this theme, you will be in a better position to make wise choices about how to make sure that you are participating in the type of communication that you need to feel optimally nurtured.  Research has shown that intimacy is enhanced when vulnerable behavior, such as expressing your wants and needs, is reinforced with behaviors such as positive and loving responses, rather than stifled by behaviors such as premature problem solving and criticism. Therefore, It is important to reinforce your partner when they open up to communicate their wants and needs, to help them feel validated and to encourage them to open up again.',
		'The quality of your friendship often serves as the strong foundation of your union. Any cracks in this foundation should be addressed to help ensure the long-term success and strength of your intimate relationship.   The research suggests that expressing your wants and needs is an important part of healthy relationships. Although expressing oneself in this manner can be uncomfortable and even seem selfish at times, effectively expressing wants and needs can be used as a tool to bring couples closer together as both partners and as friends.   You may have, at one time in your relationship, viewed one another as a source of social and emotional support. This part of the friendship can be damaged, however, if either of you are critical, uninterested, or too quick to problem solve when the other person is talking. Most partners hope to be heard and understood by their partners, and a breakdown of this communication can leave partners feeling lonely and upset. Some conversations that couples have are just about enjoying each other’s company and being good friends and intimate partners, and some are problem-solving conversations, and it is important to determine which type of conversation you are having, so that you treat your partner appropriately and best address their needs.   In addition, the friendship between you and your partner can quickly start to deteriorate if you stop giving it the attention it needs. Although most couples are busy with work, family, and other important commitments, your relationship deserves and requires as much time and energy, if not more, than do your other commitments.   Time together is the most basic ingredient of a healthy friendship.  The type of time together that appears to be the most nurturing to a healthy friendship has at least three main ingredients. The first is simple time. Real, dedicated, sprawling, unhurried time. The second is genuine loving attention. Genuine attention involves looking deeply with fresh eyes and listening closely with an open heart. Time to really see each other, time to be genuinely curious about each other, time to be continually getting to know each other. Finally, the third ingredient is non-judgmental, openhearted presence. This is not the time to find and solve problems. It is not the time to work on changing each other. It is simply time to spend enjoying each other’s company.',
		'There are a number of possible reasons why you fail to give each other adequate emotional support. One option might be that one partner seems so strong and self-sufficient that the other partner does not feel like they need support, or does not see room for their support to be helpful. Alternately, one partner’s level of need for support may be confusing or overwhelming to the other partner, leaving the “supporting” partner immobilized or unclear on what they can do to help. And, what happens very often is that both of you are in need of support, and so you are unable to fully give your attention and support to your partner.   It appears that you have, in some ways, fallen into a pattern of struggle for each other’s attention which results in neither of you getting quite what you need, and at the same time makes you unable to respond fully and supportively to each other’s attempts at affection. At its worst, the outcome can be an unproductive verbal tug of war to demonstrate whose concerns are larger or more real.   Many couples today are finding that they have less and less time to spend genuinely nurturing their relationship with each other. The demands of work, family, community, and home unite to fill every available moment and partners easily give in and put their relationship on the back burner while they attend to all the other pressing demands on their time. It is becoming more and more clear that an intimate relationship is a living breathing being and that, as such, it simply requires regular care and feeding. Perhaps the most basic form of that regular care and feeding is time spent being lovingly attentive to each other. You can starve a relationship of attention for a period of time and it will survive on its own stored resources. Eventually, however, even the strongest relationship will simply starve to death. It simply cannot be emphasized strongly enough how vitally important it is for partners to spend real time together, that in this case includes looking deeply to understand the others’ concerns and stresses and finding small ways to support each other.  Research has shown that there are four types of “filters” that can affect couples as they struggle for good communication: 1) inattention, 2) emotional states, 3) beliefs and expectations, and 4) differences in style. When you are feeling like you and your partner are not supporting each other, take a step back and evaluate your communication around the issue. It is possible and even likely that one of these four “filters” is holding you back from really listening to and empathizing with your partner.',
		'You both sometimes feel that you do not talk about the things that you truly feel are most meaningful in your lives. You may often express that you have a sincere desire to know those things that are the most meaningful and important to your partner but that instead you feel that much of your conversation focuses on superficial or emotionally uncomplicated topics that leave you unfulfilled in terms of your desire to connect and know your partner on a deeper level.  Sometimes you may feel that your communication sometimes lacks a deeper, more meaningful quality. You may feel that conversations happen at the functional level, and that you are missing that more in-depth level of conversation in your relationship. While on the one hand day-to-day chit-chat is the life blood of relationships, putting effort into communicating about more complicated and deep issues is also essential.  Research has shown that intimacy is enhanced when vulnerable behavior, such as expressing your wants, needs, dreams, and ways that you find meaning in the world, is reinforced with behaviors such as positive and loving responses, rather than stifled by behaviors such as changing the subject, premature problem solving, and criticism. This research further suggests that the self-disclosure of personal thoughts and emotions is an important aspect of healthy relationships.  You may be finding that you have less and less time to spend genuinely nurturing your relationship with each other. The demands of work, family, community, and home unite to fill every available moment and partners easily give in and put their relationship on the back burner while they attend to all the other pressing demands on their time. It is becoming more and more clear that an intimate relationship is a living breathing being and that, as such, it simply requires regular care and feeding. Perhaps the most basic form of that regular care and feeding is time spent talking together, learning more about each other on a deeper level. It simply cannot be emphasized strongly enough how vitally important it is for partners to spend real time getting to really know each other and to connect on an intimate and genuine level.',
		'There are a number of possible reasons why you may fail to give each other adequate levels of support on the things that you find most important as individuals. One option is that you may not know or understand what is important to your partner Also, what happens very often is that you know what is important to your partner but you are in need of support yourself or are too busy focused on other areas of your life, and so you are unable to fully give your attention and support to your partner.    It appears that you have in some ways fallen into a pattern of struggle for each other’s attention which results in neither of you getting quite what you need, and at the same time makes you unable to respond fully and supportively to each other’s attempts at affection. At its worst, the outcome can be an unproductive verbal tug of war to demonstrate whose concerns are larger or more real.   Today you are finding that you have less and less time to spend genuinely nurturing your relationship with each other. The demands of work, family, community, and home unite to fill every available moment and partners easily give in and put their relationship on the back burner while they attend to all the other pressing demands on their time. It is becoming more and more clear that an intimate relationship is a living breathing being and that, as such, it simply requires regular care and feeding. Perhaps one of the most basic form of that regular care and feeding is time spent caring for and supporting each other. It simply cannot be emphasized strongly enough how vitally important it is for partners to look deeply to understand each others’ concerns and values and find small yet meaningful ways to support each other.',
		'There are many reasons why partners may disengage from actively participating in and working on their relationship. These include, but certainly are not limited to, a sense that the relationship is a ‘given’ and as such does not require ongoing sustenance, a lack of intimacy that causes and maintains a state of distance, or perhaps a belief that certain issues within the relationship are simply irresolvable.  Couples often find themselves feeling like they lead parallel lives. It is easy to place other commitments such as work, family, or personal interests at a higher priority on a day to day basis, but this trend will eventually begin to undermine the quality of your relationship. The research suggests that maintaining a strong foundation for your intimate connection is critical to long-term success.  Many couples today are finding that they have less and less time to spend genuinely nurturing their relationship with each other. Time together, however, while it seems almost too simple, is the most basic ingredient of a healthy intimate relationship. It is becoming more and more clear that a romantic relationship is a living breathing being and that, as such, it simply requires regular care and feeding. Perhaps the most basic form of that regular care and feeding is real time spent being lovingly attentive to each other. You can starve a relationship of intentional time for a period of time and it will survive on its own stored resources. Eventually, however, even the strongest of relationships will simply starve to death. It simply cannot be emphasized strongly enough how vitally important it is for partners to spend real time together.  The type of time together that appears to be the most nurturing to a healthy relationship has at least three main ingredients. The first is real, dedicated time. The second is genuine loving attention. Genuine attention involves looking deeply with fresh eyes and listening closely with an open heart. This means being genuinely curious about each other, and open to continually getting to know each other. Finally, the third ingredient is a non-judgmental presence. This is not the time to find and solve problems. It is not the time to work on changing each other. It is simply time to spend enjoying each other’s company.  John Gottman, a leading couples researcher, has found that this intimacy sustaining time can take as little as five minutes here and there throughout the day. He talks about creating and maintaining what he calls “Love maps” by spending a little bit of genuinely attentive time at the beginning of the day being actively curious about what is going on in your partner’s life that day so you can carry a loving thought of them throughout the day. Then again at the end of the day, he recommends spending another, possibly brief, time being curious about how your partner’s day unfolded. Although these shared moments don’t have to be lengthy, they must involve your full-hearted and non-judgmental attention. Of course, it is also recommended that healthy couples also spend some regular time together that feels more leisurely, perhaps weekly.',
		'Many couples wish that they could be more affectionate with each other, but are held back for a variety of reasons including upbringing, level of desired closeness, or simple lack of time to spend together.   One issue that is often problematic is the lack of verbally affectionate communication. You may have tried to hint or have actually asked for compliments and more positive statements of love, and have been refused or had your request go unanswered. On the other side of this, some partners are uncomfortable and unfamiliar with high levels of verbal affection, and may not understand their importance to others.   For some couples, a lack of affection seems to be closely related to the time they spend together. Both of you are finding that they have less and less time to spend genuinely nurturing your relationship with each other. Although you may desire to be more verbally affectionate, the demands of work, family, community, and home leave you so busy and/or tired that you have to put you relationship on the back burner while you attend to all the other pressing demands on your time.   In addition, it is important to recognize that what one partner sees is not always an accurate reflection of what the other partner feels. For example, you may feel very loving towards your spouse, but instead of saying “I love you” you say “I had a good time with you yesterday.” However, your partner may not understand this to be a statement of affection, and remain annoyed that you never say “I love you.” Once you begin to recognize these differing levels of emotions and comfort ability, you can begin to move toward each other in a loving manner.  For some partners, the issue of amount of affection is more centered around the desired level of closeness or intimacy. Often, one partner wants to be more physically and/or verbally affectionate on a regular basis, while the other partner prefers to be more distant, or at least less close when in public.',
		'Pragmatic financial issues are indeed a real source of stress; however communication around these issues can decrease the stress and pain to a less intense level. Cultivating a new way to understand your differing emotional relationships with money may help to lessen some of the real fears and concerns you each have, and provide you with the additional psychological strength that comes from knowing you have someone on your side.   The literature also suggests that it is important to the overall health of a relationship for you to listen empathically to each other and be engaged in the discussion even when there is not agreement on the severity ‘rating’ of a problem. That is, it is often more important to us to feel that our partner understands that something really matters to us, even if he or she can’t care in quite the same way about it.   We often have differences in our emotional relationship to money. These are usually fundamental differences between partners that are essentially unchangeable, and the best way to come to relate around this begins with recognizing that the other person has a different emotional experience in relation to money. The most common of these differences is typically called the “spender-saver pattern.” In this pattern, one partner may not feel like she is able to live life to its fullest if money becomes more like something to worry about than to use toward valued goals and generosity. On the other hand, the other partner may not feel safe and able to relax unless he is putting away some of their money in savings. One suggestion in navigating these differences is to be accepting of each other’s emotional response to money while being able to negotiate, compromise and respect each other’s needs and desires in financial matters. When partners know that they have a spender-saver pattern and that the underlying issue involves one partner\'s feeling of safety and security and the other partner\'s feeling of freedom and generosity, then each partner is in a better position to take good and loving care of the other. The saver can make sure that some of their money is available for guilt-free spending and open generosity and the spender can make sure that some of their money is put aside in a safe place to provide the emotional safety net necessary to other partner\'s well being. In this way, each partner learns that they can trust the other with what matters most deeply to them when it comes to money.',
		'It is quite common for couples to have philosophical and stylistic differences when it comes to parenting. The research literature on co-parenting suggests that even with different styles, it is quite possible to co-parent effectively and to your children’s benefit.   The research suggests that it is how you approach this common friction point, rather than the existence of the friction point per se, that determines how well you co-parent and thus how well your children benefit from that co-parenting. If you can non-judgmentally acknowledge your philosophical and stylistic differences and work collaboratively and actively towards compromise, you will tend to be more satisfied with your co-parenting and more effective at it. Parents who are judgmental about their partner’s style and who stumble into competing with each other about who is “right,” tend to be less satisfied and less effective as co-parents.   It is not uncommon for one partner to take on the roll of CEO of parenting and the other the role of “assistant manager.” When this pattern creates friction it is often in the form of one partner feeling like she isn’t getting the help she needs or that she always has to be in charge, and for the other partner to feel like he has a “boss” and is seen as a bumbling employee.  Tensions around parenting differences are not unusual.  What makes these issues particularly susceptible to friction has to do with the depth to which we all learn our approaches to parenting.  We all appear to learn our parenting styles through a combination of (a) modeling how our parents parented us, (b) any early practice we may have had caring for younger siblings, and (c) our own efforts to deliberately learn and practice specific parenting skills.  Because most of our instincts about parenting were learned from our own parents, we tend to internalize those parenting instincts at a “bone-deep” level.  Because our parenting styles are so deeply embedded, when our partner has a noticeably different style, the contrast can be jarring and it is very easy to see that different style as “wrong” because it so deeply feels wrong given our own deeply held perspective.  The bottom line is that it is common for partners to have different, and deeply held, parenting styles and that it is almost inevitable that the difference will become a source of recurring friction between partners.  While these problems concerning parenting differences have no easy solution, the important aspect for couples’ relationships is how you stand together in relation to these dilemmas. It is essential that you remain especially cautious about the polarizing properties that these issues can have - in other words, it is easy for this type of issue to come between you, but it is healthier if you can find a way to stand on the same side of a problem from which you both suffer. Developing a mutually compassionate stance can be accomplished by practicing compassion for one’s self, one’s partner, and one’s children, even when they act in less than preferable ways. Research suggests that partners do not necessarily have to agree with each other when it comes to issues like parenting; what appears to matter more is that they can commiserate with each other about how they both struggle with their shared issue (researchers call this “glorifying the struggle”). Partners who can support each other around shared challenges and shared disagreements can actually experience increased intimacy in their relationship. The key to developing a genuine intimacy around this issue is for you as a couple to strive to deeply understand each other and the children.',
		'Substance abuse problems can be very difficult for couples to address because of the highly charged emotions involved such as fear, guilt and/or worry for themselves as individuals—as well as concerns about their relationship.  Sharing concerns in this may be extremely difficult, but will be rewarding to the relationship.  We know that when couples use open and constructive communication skills, each partner feels:  (a) safe to express his/her thoughts and feelings; (b) heard and understood while communicating; (c) safe to talk about what they need and to problem solve about how to meet those needs in healthy ways; and (d) intimate and connected emotionally.    One way that substance abuse can be harmful to couples’ relationships is through the deterioration of feelings of trust and safety. When one partner is using substances that alter their behavior, they may act differently towards their partner, sometimes in a threatening or frightening manner. Partners using substances may also withdraw from or ignore their partners, again leaving them feeling alone and possibly afraid. When this sort of pattern settles into a relationship, the non-abusing partner may be left feeling unsafe with their partner, as there is a sense of uncertainty and anxiety in the relationship, and may no longer trust their partner to be able to take care of themselves and/or the household.   Substance abuse can also hinder the quality of the relationship more indirectly. For example, partners who have been hurt by their partner\'s substance abuse may be unwilling to be emotionally vulnerable and intimate even after their partner has stopped abusing substances. Couples may also find themselves simply drifting apart if one partner is heavily into substance use while the other is not.    Part of what makes this issue so difficult to resolve is that you and your partner have fallen into what is sometimes referred to as a mutual trap. The key to resolving this area of concern will be learning to lean into places that will initially seem fairly uncomfortable.',
		'It can be uncomfortable and challenging, to both the physical body and the relationship, when a partner experiences a pain or illness. Whether these issues are new or chronic, they can have a profound impact on the intimate connection between the two of you.   As the research shows, working as a team may enhance your capacity to make meaningful adjustments to promote and sustain your individual health as well as your health as a couple.  As noted in the research literature, balance and equality is valued among psychologically healthy couples, and the relationship creates a context that fosters both individuals’ growth.  By allowing your roles to be somewhat flexible, you can shift responsibilities to take care of a partner in need.  For instance, if a medical problem arises that shifts the balance in role responsibilities, the healthiest couples approaches this shift both mindfully and intentionally.  One way to navigate this shift is to negotiate new ways to contribute to the relationship so that they each feel valued and respected.',
		'Although mental health issues may have already peaked and been dealt with to a great degree in the relationship, there is a certain ongoing level of stress. These mental health concerns are not individual matters, but are mutually experienced in the context of intimate relationships and understandably and naturally have an effect on relationship dynamics. The research shows that working as a team may enhance your capacity to make meaningful adjustments to promote and sustain your individual health as well as your health as a couple.    Mental health problems can be very difficult for couples to address because of the highly charged emotions involved such as fear, guilt and/or worry for themselves as individuals—as well as concerns about their relationship.  Sharing concerns in this may be extremely difficult, but will be rewarding to the relationship. Couples are encouraged to use open and constructive communication skills, so each partner feels:  (a) safe to express his/her thoughts and feelings; (b) heard and understood while communicating; (c) safe to talk about what they need and to problem solve about how to meet those needs in healthy ways; and (d) intimate and connected emotionally.    Research suggests that depression can be both the cause and the result of intimacy problems and dissatisfaction. It can also cause people in otherwise happy relationships to perceive themselves and their relationship in negative ways.  There are many options for dealing with depression, including psychotropic medication, individual counseling, and couples counseling. Research on depression has shown that most people are able to recover, but it is much more difficult and takes much longer without proper therapy. A combination of cognitive/behavioral therapy and well-managed drug treatment, managed together by mental health professionals, is the most effective treatment. Psychotropic medication helps alleviate symptoms more quickly, while cognitive/behavioral therapy helps the client deal with the underlying issues, make lifestyle changes, and helps to “prolong the cure” or increase the likelihood that an individual will stay symptom free for a long period of time. The research also demonstrates that people who have had more than one depressive episode in the past are likely to have another in the future. Therapy can help couples to recognize the signs of depressive symptoms returning and take the proper action in response. In addition to therapy, there are several books that may provide important suggestions for both partners.   It is of course important for you to continue to be able to have an open channel of emotional communication with your partner. In turn, it is important that he/she is able to voice concerns, fears, and stresses on his/her own. The expression of such fears and concerns may easily be perceived as blaming on the part of the listener, yet it is clear that there is no blame or accusation taking place within this relationship, rather a bid for mutual support.  It may be helpful to think of depression and anxiety not as something for either of you to “fix” or make go away for the other, but to take a stance of companionship and mutual compassion in the face of a not-uncommon guest that occasionally takes up residence, but whom neither of you invited into your relationship.',
		'We know from relevant research that major life transitions, such as the birth of a child, changing jobs, or retirement, are commonly accompanied by a period of adjustment and tension. This is an area where many couples struggle to create new routines and handle the drastic change in daily contact with one another. Issues that may have previously been kept under the surface are often exposed in these periods, due to the new levels of stress and contact.   While some researchers argue that relationship problems are more likely to crop up during times of transition and stress, others report that couples experiencing stressful/traumatic events often report increased closeness. That being said, it is very common for couples to experience temporary decreases in their relationship satisfaction. Couples who support one another through the stressful situation, and who have better communication and relationship maintenance skills, have a better chance of returning to their original relationship satisfaction levels. Evidence suggests that maintaining regular daily contact is another characteristic of strong and resilient couples.  Research on the development of couples’ relationships over time has shown that the decrease in satisfaction with their sexual relationship that couples sometimes experience is perhaps one of the most common developmental occurrences in relationships, especially following certain big transitions. Despite the fact that decreases in the frequency and priority of sex are normal and predictable across transition (for example, the transition to parenthood), they are often a source of distress to intimate partners. More often than not, the distress caused by this issue is related to partners’ desire for affection, acceptance, and intimacy throughout the relationship. Other times, this distress is a product of busy schedules, long tiring days, and stress from these life transitions.  Along with the difficulty of dealing with a major life stressor, couples can easily fall into a pattern of struggling for each other’s attention which results in neither of them getting quite what they need, and at the same time makes them unable to respond fully and supportively to each other’s attempts at affection. At its worst, the outcome can be an unproductive verbal tug of war to demonstrate whose concerns are larger or more real.  Many couples today are finding that they have less and less time to spend genuinely nurturing their relationship with each other. The demands of work, family, community, and home unite to fill every available moment and partners easily give in and put their relationship on the back burner while they attend to all the other pressing demands on their time. It is becoming more and more clear that an intimate relationship is a living breathing being and that, as such, it simply requires regular care and feeding. Perhaps the most basic form of that regular care and feeding is time spent being lovingly attentive to each other. You can starve a relationship of time for a period of time and it will survive on its own stored resources. Eventually, however, even the strongest of relationships will simply starve to death. It simply cannot be emphasized strongly enough how vitally important it is for partners to spend real time together, especially in the face of significant changes.',

		'In the transition to retirement, an influential factor can be the previous situation and expectations of the retiree and his/her partner. For some partners who have had a very busy career full of activity, a slow and relaxing retirement may seem tedious. For others, relaxation may be just what they have been working towards. It is important to remember that this transition is different for everyone.  We know from relevant research that major life transitions, such as retirement, are commonly accompanied by a period of adjustment and tension.

		'According to the research, spillover between work interactions and relationship interactions is a very common occurrence.  According to one researcher, Len Sperry, M.D., Ph.D., “If the culture of your work is such that you are expected to be married to your job, that is where you’re going to devote your time and attention. Under these conditions, anyone who wants to pay attention to their relationship would be considered an adulterer.”  The quality of a person’s most intimate relationship depends, to some extent, on the quality of his or her work life because the association between job stress and partner conflict goes both ways.  Job strain can harm relationships and relationship strain can get in the way of job productivity.    The issue of work stress can be a major issue for many couples. Couples often note that their lives undergo dramatic shifts due to their taking on a challenging new career or taking on more responsibility at their current job. Transitions are particularly hard periods of adaptation for couples. In particular, the transition to new jobs for one or both partners can be very difficult for couples, as new jobs can often create a very high level of stress surrounding such issues as money, time together, and individual needs.  One issue that can come up when couples are dealing with high levels of stress is unhealthy coping styles. Under stress, partners may “go quiet” and turn inward to deal with the situation, while others may lash out with their emotions. Neither of these patterns leave partners in a good place to communicate with and support each other in difficult times.   Research on job stress spillover has found that people are generally unaware of how much the stress from work follows them home.  If that is the case, then it helps to be more mindful that if things have been hard at work that day, then you may feel a little crankier with your partner about things that you normally would let roll off your back.  Knowing that can help you take some of the minor annoyances with a grain of salt.  Especially in times of transitions at work, it may help to recognize work/job stress as a chronic stressor for awhile.  In doing so, you can recognize the importance of scheduling regular breaks with each other in order to pace yourselves in a more gentle way.  Another issue that can be important in the domain of work stress is that of social support. The partner(s) who is stressed at work will likely come home looking to vent and be supported because of their tough situation. For many reasons, their partner may not be able to provide this support, possibly because they themselves are busy with work, or because they would rather be spending time with their partner talking about something other than work. When this occurs, our recommendation is for you both to agree to set aside a little bit of time to vent about your days with each other and to provide one another with emotional support, validation, and, to the degree that it is requested, problem solving. Then, after the agreed amount of time, switch your attention to being with each other and with your family, and to ground your attention in the home that you are creating together.',
		'The effects of a partner’s affair can last many years after the event actually happened and can show themselves in many domains of a couple’s relationship. The work of developing a greater understanding of the issue and working toward a deeper sense of emotional resolution can be difficult and emotionally challenging work. The research literature in this area suggests, however, that couples can find healthy ways of coming to terms with past affairs that allow for new growth, improved relationship health, and a greater sense of intimacy and shared serenity. Although possible, this work is often difficult for couples to do on their own and can be aided greatly with assistance of a trained couples therapist.   In stumbling around to try and find a way out of the very painful territory that they are currently in, couples who are struggling with trust issues often end up in a pattern that actually only keeps them stranded and alone. In an effort to find the comfort of resolution and some conclusive sign from your partner that will put your own fears to rest, you question and demand that he/she admit to the worst of your own suspicions. Your partner, on the other hand, attempts to avoid the whole thing entirely by hiding information from you that he/she is concerned will needlessly spark your own fears. The result of all these efforts is increased suspicion on both sides. The bad news is that these mutual behaviors tend to keep couples locked in this pattern. The good news, however, is that because your behavior is so interlinked, changes that either of you makes in order to change the pattern will likely be noticed and appreciated by the other.   It does not in fact matter where and how a partner’s sense of doubt and fear arose, it is simply part of the package. In order to restore a full sense of being part of a team, you will have to look beyond your own individual interests. One of you will likely need to tolerate some sense of not knowing, while the other will need to go above and beyond to ensure a greater sense of security. Just as keeping a plant alive and healthy takes ongoing watering, re-cultivating love and warmth will take ongoing reassurance and comforting. Rebuilding trust is by its nature a process that takes time and patience.',
		'It is clear that you want very much to trust your partner, and your partner in turn wants to be trusted by you. You both want the same sense of companionship, unity, and we-ness that you enjoy in virtually all other aspects of your lives together. When your sense of team suddenly breaks down and you find yourselves at odds, it is particularly painful and clearly hurts both of you.

		'Some conversations are about problem solving and some conversations are just about enjoying each other’s company and being good friends and intimate partners. Where you as a couple appear to falter is in making the transition to addressing problems.  Research has shown that intimacy is enhanced when vulnerable behavior, such as expressing your wants and needs, is reinforced with behaviors such as positive and loving responses, rather than stifled by behaviors such as premature problem solving and criticism. This research further suggests that the self-disclosure of personal thoughts and emotions is an important aspect of healthy relationships.  The best type of communication between partners’ results in both partners feeling like the other person really understands where they are coming from, even if they don’t necessarily agree. When partners jump prematurely into problem solving, either or both partners can end up feeling like they haven’t been taken seriously and heard with a respectful and empathic ear. When that happens, problem solving can bog down, not because the solution is necessarily difficult, but because no solution feels right if a person feels like it has been arrived at without their partner fully understanding and empathizing with their concerns. These sorts of solutions leave partners feeling dismissed and more isolated rather than respected and like a good team.  A common pattern can emerge between partners that often results in feelings of hurt, anger, or isolation. It almost always involves just those topics that both partners have some real emotional or practical investment in. Under these circumstances, partners can sometimes become so focused on solving the problem at hand that they stop focusing on the needs and feelings of their partner. In a sense we could call it “premature problem-solving.”   In addition, you may feel that your partner’s problem solving is getting in the way of spending quality time together. The type of time together that appears to be the most nurturing to a healthy relationship has at least three main ingredients. The first is simple time: real, dedicated, sprawling, unhurried time. The second is genuine loving attention. Genuine attention involves looking deeply with fresh eyes and listening closely with an open heart. Time to really see each other, time to be genuinely curious about each other, time to be continually getting to know each other. Finally, the third ingredient is non-judgmental, openhearted presence. This is not the time to find and solve problems. It is not the time to work on changing each other. It is simply time to spend enjoying each other’s company.',

Issues that may have previously been kept under the surface are often exposed in these periods, due to the new levels of stress and contact.  The issues in your life are indeed a real source of stress, and a lack of communication around these issues can increase the level of pain and stress.

The demands of work, family, community, and home unite to fill every available moment and partners easily give in and put their relationship on the back burner while they attend to all the other pressing demands on their time. It is becoming more and more clear that an intimate relationship is a living breathing being and that, as such, it simply requires regular care and feeding. Perhaps the most basic form of that regular care and feeding is time spent being lovingly attentive to each other. You can starve a relationship of time for a brief period and it will survive on its own stored resources. Eventually, however, even the strongest of relationships will simply starve to death. It simply cannot be emphasized strongly enough how vitally important it is for partners to spend real time together, especially during times of great stress.  One issue that can come up when couples are dealing with high levels of stress is unhealthy coping styles. Under stress, partners may “clam up” and turn inward to deal with the situation, while others may lash out with their emotions. Neither of these patterns leave partners in a good place to communicate with and support each other in difficult times.',
		'For many, anger is a natural emotion that occurs as a result of the everyday friction produced by basic differences. However, for some couples, communicating anger can be an unusually negative experience that often goes too far.  Frequently people\'s anger skills are dominated by behaviors such as raising one’s voice, shouting, threatening, throwing objects, or crying.  While these behaviors may be useful when dealing with danger, they become destructive when used to deal with your partner as it can lead to resentment and defensiveness.   Research does show that it is possible to increase the amount of positive choices available to individuals when dealing with anger.  Anger has no more control over our behavior than other emotions such as elation or desire.  When we receive news that makes us want to run down the hallways jumping for joy, we make the decision whether or not to carry out that behavior or replace the impulse with whistling a happy tune.  Similarly, there are choices to be made in the face of anger.  When anger is directed at a partner instead of the problem, the partner may become distressed, fearful, or withdrawn.  By redirecting the anger to the problem, the energy can be used to problem solve.  Recognizing the source of the anger can help you eliminate it.  According to emotions research, anger is usually a secondary emotion, occurring after fear, hurt, or loneliness.  Identifying the emotion that comes before feeling angry is critical to understanding the resulting anger.',
		'Different communication styles may cause you to feel frustrated, like you are not collaborating together as a team around problems that arise in your lives, but rather these issues are left unresolved.  In this way, couples often become stuck in this type of pattern and then may have difficulty resolving important issues in their relationship.  Some conversations that you have are just about enjoying each other’s company and being good friends and intimate partners, and some are problem-solving conversations. Where you as a couple appear to falter is in making the transition to addressing problems. While you have clearly built a strong and satisfying union as it stands, there are some things that you may add to your repertoires that would likely enhance your ability to speak candidly with one another.   You may be falling into what we call the “demand/withdraw” interaction pattern, especially when discussing sensitive topics. Generally this describes a pattern in which one partner expresses a desire for change from the other partner, which evokes a desire to withdraw from the other partner. The withdrawal may arise out of the way the desire is expressed, or because the nature of the request is overwhelming in some way, or some combination of the two. The partner’s withdrawal then sets the stage for even more demands or an escalation in intensity from the first partner, which in turn leads to more withdrawal. In this way, you often become stuck in this type of pattern and then may have difficulty resolving important issues in your relationship.  It is important to note that “withdraw” does not necessarily mean leaving, but can mean “taking a step back” emotionally because the topic seems like an invitation to unhealthy conflict or because the interaction has become emotionally flooding. In turn, “demand” does not mean that the request is not legitimate. In fact, the motive is often very positive, such as wanting to engage in a discussion with a partner whose perspective and collaboration you very much respect and value. “Demand” is a natural and understandable response to a partner who withdraws or does not seem to realize the urgency of a need that is not being met.  The research suggests that it is how couples approach their common friction points, rather than the existence of the friction points per se, that determines how well they work together to solve problems. Partners who can non-judgmentally acknowledge their philosophical and stylistic differences and work collaboratively and actively towards compromise tend to be more satisfied with their difficult issues and more effective at it. Partners who are judgmental about their partner’s style and who stumble into competing with each other about who is “right” become dissatisfied with their problem solving skills and typically solve problems less effectively.   The best type of communication between partners results in both partners feeling like the other person really understands where they are coming from, even if they don’t necessarily agree. When you both jump prematurely into problem solving, either or both partners can end up feeling like they haven’t been taken seriously and heard with a respectful and empathic ear. When that happens, problem solving can bog down not because the solution is necessarily difficult, but because no solution feels right if a person feels like it has been arrived at without your partner fully understanding and empathizing with your concerns. These sorts of solutions leave you both feeling dismissed and more isolated rather than respected and like a good team.'

		'Practice making daily love maps. If you know that you will spend much of the day apart from each other, spend roughly five or ten minutes at the beginning of the day finding out about what that day is going to be like for your partner, with the goal of holding him or her warmly in your thoughts during the day. Then again at the end of the day, spend roughly the same amount of time listening deeply to how your partner’s day unfolded with the goal of simply being a nonjudgmental and supportive friend to your partner.',
		'Schedule time.  Many couples operate under the assumption that the time they need to nurture their relationship will magically appear in the spaces between all the other demands on their time.  Unfortunately, this type of “found time” almost never simply appears.  Although it is perhaps less romantic than we would ultimately like, scheduling time to spend together well in advance can be a real relationship saver. You might consider getting out a calendar and blocking out some time over the course of the week or month that you put aside as special and only to be spent enjoying each other’s company. We find that couples benefit most from having predictable time together that they can count on and look forward to every week or every other week. In this, the calendar is your friend. The point of this time together isn’t to struggle with major problems, but instead to simply enjoy each other’s company. The time can be spent in whatever types of activities you each find enjoyable, from having a drink together at home to jumping out of airplanes. The point is to regularly invite joy and fun into your lives together as a couple.',
		'Notice the dangerous communication pattern when it is occurring in your relationship. Be aware of the pattern and call it out—“We are entering into *our pattern* again.” You can even give it a name—call it “The trap, our dance, or even hippopotamus" if you like.  This may help to create just enough distance between you and this pattern for you to be able to be able to discuss the pattern together as a couple. The goals might be (1) to begin to recognize the signs of the negative interaction, before you are fully in it; (2) to signal that you need to do something proactive in that moment, in order to step out of the pattern.',
		'Notice when your communication is bogging down and check to see if you might have stopped listening with an empathic ear. If you notice that you have, turn it back on and actively let your partner know that you hear him or her and that you can empathize with where he or she is coming from. It is very likely that you will notice that the rest of the conversation begins to go more smoothly. Take note of what is happening, in real-time, as you start to see it emerging. This will hopefully prevent you from saying hurtful things and getting stuck in your usual pattern of fighting, so you can have the discussion without it becoming a negative experience.',
		'Attempt to soften your "start up." Arguments first "start up" because one spouse sometimes escalates the conflict from the very beginning by opening with a critical or contemptuous remark in a confrontational tone.

		'Expand your notions of a sexual relationship to include activities other than intercourse. Many couples set themselves up for disappointment and failure through maintaining sexual expectations that may be too narrow given their continuing development as a couple. Moreover you may be missing opportunities for pleasurable connection that could be achieved as distinct from the act of intercourse when you over-focus on the act itself. Focus on the process rather than the outcome. If you determine to spend real quality time together that is simply to be sensual and erotic, then the outcome can be beside the point.',

		'Work on being aware of the feelings that accompany your non-disclosure pattern and use those feelings as a way of “waking up” to the fact that the uninvited guest has moved in. If you wake up after the fact, you can begin the process of repair. If you wake up right in the middle withdrawing and holding in your wants and needs, you can call it by its name and short-circuit it. In other words, simply notice this type of interaction when it comes up and choose to lean into places where intuition tells you to lean out. Naming our patterns with a sense of humor can help us to hold them more graciously and, to the extent that they are problematic, engage in them less frequently.',
		'Did you know that just watching a good movie together is good for your relationship?Recent research has found that watching a movie (especially one that features an intimate relationship) with your partner and then spending time discussing the film afterwards has significant benefits to your connection. Consider adding in a movie night to your routine and then explore the following questions together:   - Did the couple strive to understand each other? Did they tend to accept one another, even if they were very different? Or did the couple tend to attack each others’ differences? - In what way was this relationship similar to or different from your own relationship in this area?  - How did the couple in the movie handle hurt feelings? Did they apologize to each other? Did the apologies seem sincere? Did they tend to jump to negative conclusions when their feelings got hurt, or did they tend to give each other the benefit of the doubt?  - In what way was this relationship similar to or different from your own relationship in this area?  - What main problem(s) did the couple face?

They also report that being able to look forward to this time away together helps them cope well with some of the feelings of drudgery that come up over the course of the year.

Each of these moments between you can be a journey with no particular destinations. Practice letting go of your expectations and becoming fully available to the experience of this moment between you and your partner. Guilt may be automatic for both of you, but don’t take it too seriously. Don’t feel like you have to wrestle with it. Give yourselves permission to just be however you are.

		'Even when things at work are following you home in a very demanding way, having some relaxing time remains essential to overall well-being. Consider exploring ways to carve out space and time to enjoy some of your time at home as genuine “time off” for rest, recuperation, and recreation. You may have your own rituals that you can bring to this that allow you to share some carefree space.',
		'Read the chapter from “Fighting for Your Marriage,” by Howard J. Markman on forgiveness.

Unfortunately, this type of “found time” almost never simply appears.  Although it is perhaps less romantic than we would ultimately like, scheduling time to spend together well in advance can be a real relationship saver.  Some couples find it helpful to think of scheduling as scheduling time for a date.',
		'Identify two small or simple things that each of you can do to provide comfort or support to one another when the other is having a difficult time or bad day. The key is for them to be brief and simple, so that your partner can easily do this to show their desire to comfort you, without providing additional stress when they themselves may feel quite overworked or busy.',

		'It is common for couples to have different personal histories of affectionate behaviors, and also differences in what feels natural to them as far as affection.  However, affection is naturally nurturing to intimate relationships.  Remembering to water plants may not come naturally, but if you want plants, you would have to find ways to remind yourself to water them.  In the same way, finding ways to remind yourselves to be affectionate with each other in those spots where it may not come naturally could help you to meet the goals you want in the relationship.  Reminders might come in the form of sticky notes, phone notices, or code-words; it is just important to find something that works with your unique relationship style and daily routine.',

Unfortunately, this type of “found time” almost never simply appears. Although it is perhaps less romantic than we would ultimately like, scheduling time to spend together well in advance can be a real relationship saver. You might consider getting out a calendar and blocking out some time over the course of the week or month that you put aside as special and only to be spent enjoying each other’s company. We find that couples benefit most from having predictable time together that they can count on and look forward to every week or every other week. In this, the calendar is your friend. Again, the point of this time together isn’t to struggle with major problems, but instead to enjoy each other’s company. The time can be spent in whatever types of activities you each find enjoyable, from having a drink together at home to jumping out of airplanes. The point is to be regularly inviting joy and fun into your lives together as a couple.',

		'Schedule regular meetings where you can pay the bills or do financial planning together. At first this can be very emotionally challenging, but over time, if you practice your communication and listen to each other in a thoughtful way, you will likely find that you understand each other better and develop a greater sense of partnership and shared concerns when it comes to you financial outlook. Recognize and appreciate that this is a particularly stressful arena of your relationship. If you can practice being emotionally supportive of each other on this challenging front, the overall health of your relationship benefits because you are facing a challenging time together as friends and allies. By meeting regularly you will create a regular context for addressing this issue rather than avoiding it.',

		'When dealing with this illness, it may come to pass that the caregiver is not reserving personal time for him/herself as an individual.  As time passes, these seemingly small sacrifices of personal time intensify and can become overwhelming which can lead to what researchers call “caregiver burnout.” In order to avoid this cycle, it is important to establish a caregiver routine, which includes each of you taking time for yourself.  Try to do something for yourself everyday even if only for ten minutes.  Yoga, listening to your favorite music, reading the newspaper, taking a walk around the neighborhood… whatever it is that is time spent specifically for you.  Carve that time out for respite, which will keep you healthy while you are helping to keep your partner healthy.',
		'Practice acceptance. For the partner who has a mental illness, this may mean accepting some of the vulnerability that the supporting partner brings to the table, which can be a real source of strength in your relationship. There is a tendency for words such as “depression” and “anxiety” to carry a great deal of judgment in our society, yet the flip side of these tendencies is a capacity for sensitivity, insight, and compassion that others may well not have, and which allows you to clearly be a very loving companion to your partner. For the supporting partner, this may mean accepting that you do not, in fact, have the capacity to control and to fix, even when it comes to the well-being of those you love the most. Furthermore, it may also mean noticing and accepting a vulnerability and need for assistance in yourself that may get obscured in your efforts to take care of others.',

Many couples have found that consciously and actively setting aside regular time for being close, both emotionally and physically, is of great benefit and often becomes the sort of emotional haven that both partners look forward to during the rest of the week.

		'If you find yourselves getting stuck in your own efforts to resolve this issue, seeing a qualified couples or sex therapist could only be beneficial. Make sure you’re seeing someone who has specific training. The research literature consistently suggests that therapy with someone who has had specific training in couples/sex therapy dramatically improves the odds that couples will move back into the intimately satisfied range and maintain those improvements over time. No treatment is guaranteed to work for everyone, but our best evidence suggests that couples that have become stuck in discomforting patterns, but that have not deteriorated to the point of severe distress, have a high likelihood of benefiting greatly from a short course of couple therapy. Too many times couples wait until their relationship has deteriorated beyond repair before they take advantage of the expertise of trained relationship health professional.',

		'Couples research has found that this regular chatting is a characteristic of the healthiest couples and is strongly associated with long-term relational health and intimacy. Touching base regularly appears to keep partners connected in a way that nurtures friendship, a sense of “we-ness,” and an ability to move more gracefully in relation to each other. Research agrees with your sense that this is a significant strength of your relationship.   The sense of interconnectedness generated in these interactions is indeed very sustaining to your relationship, and important to maintain given that the demands placed on you in other areas and within your family itself will tend to pull for all of your time and resources.  For many couples, this type of touching base daily about what is going on throughout their individual days allows for each partner to know when the other is experiencing a bad day, or dealing with a particular problem. This allows you to head many issues off at the pass, before they become full-blown crises. This type of connection also can serve as a daily reward for a relationship and can improve intimacy and sharing.',
		'The research literature suggests that your capacity to enjoy each other’s company and the quality of your friendship are significant predictors of long-term relational health.  Spending quality time together appears to keep you connected in a way that nurtures your friendship, sense of “we-ness,” and ability to move more gracefully in relation to each other.  It is becoming more and more clear that an intimate relationship is a living, breathing being, and as such, it simply requires regular care and feeding. Perhaps the most basic form of that regular care and feeding is real time spent being lovingly attentive to each other. You recognize the importance of nurturing your relationship in this way, which will not only act as a buffer against challenges life throws your way, but also add more joy and light into your relationship.',
		'To the extent that you can access and put into practice your strengths in communicating, you should be able to operate better as a team in problem solving.  In negotiating topics of disagreement or conflict, it is very important for you to stay engaged and be respectful of each other’s opinions.  It cannot be emphasized enough how important these characteristics are to a stable and satisfying relationship.  Research has shown that perhaps the most destructive things couples can do are: (1) criticize, (2) communicate contempt, (3) become overly defensive, or (4) withdraw prematurely from conversation.  Criticism is defined by comments that address the other person’s character (e.g., “You’re a slob.”), versus legitimate complaints that address the other person’s behavior (e.g., “I don’t like it when you leave your laundry on the floor.”). It seems that you have managed difficult topics particularly well, and although you may experience some issues from time to time, you generally talk in a way that leaves each other feeling secure and appreciated.   Research into problem solving between partners is perhaps the most robust in terms of the association between couple’s problem solving skills and the health of their relationship and family. To the extent that you can continue to effectively communicate around the issues that divide you without anger and hostility, problem solving will remain a strength in your relationship  Emotional openness fosters greater intimacy and being able to lean on each other creates a sense of emotional security. Both intimacy and emotional security have been shown by the research literature to be essential components of relational health and happiness, and these are both enhanced when difficult issues are addressed without anger.',
		'Couples research has shown that the most resilient couples are those that are best able to repair their emotional connection after conflicts, both big and small. Furthermore, there is growing research on the role of forgiveness in relationship health showing that a capacity for forgiveness is an essential part of long-term health and resilience.',
		'Feeling close to each other during and after sex is an important strength for many couples. This ability to be emotionally vulnerable is a sign of a secure attachment to each other, and shows the deep level of intimacy that you and your partner share.   Sometimes during periods of disagreement, partners have the initial instinct to turn away from each other in an attempt to hurt the other or create emotional distance. However, when things get tough, you may benefit from a close sexual relationship and your capacity for forgiveness to help you to turn toward one other and repair your emotional connection.',
		'This type of bone-deep acceptance will serve you very well through the course of your relationship. Couples that demonstrate grace rather than struggle against those inevitable places where you and your partner differ or fail to ‘match’ a particular ideal have more satisfied and stable relationships over time.  While all couples have their naturally occurring differences and all partners have their quirks, the healthiest couples have found ways to cope well with these differences and to accept each other for the “natural flaws in the fabric.” Recent couples research has recognized the critical role of acceptance in healthy relationship functioning.',
		'Couples research has found that the quality of a couple’s verbal affection is one of the strongest predictors of relational well-being. Partners who are regularly affectionate towards each other have been shown to be more resilient to the ups and downs of day-to-day life.    Couples research has consistently linked regular displays of affection with relational health. The quality of a couple’s affection has been shown to be one of the most basic parts of the foundation of a healthy relationship.',
		'Couples research has found that the quality of a couple’s physical affection is one of the strongest predictors of relational well-being. Partners who are regularly affectionate towards each other have been shown to be more resilient to the ups and downs of day-to-day life.    Couples research has consistently linked regular displays of affection with strong relational health. The quality of your affection is a rare and special aspect of who the two of you are together and it will help to stabilize the foundation of your entire relationship.',
		'Your shared commitment to one another and active maintenance of the quality of your relational health has helped you to form a very solid and resilient relationship. Couples research has consistently found a strong association between shared commitment and relationship health and stability. Commitment appears to be that quality of a relationship that helps partners to actively care for their relationship health and to more easily weather the difficult times.',
		'Your ability to communicate effectively has created a safe zone in your relationship that allows both of you to speak your minds and openly ask for support.  You clearly have the skills to effectively come together around the problems you face to produce a mutually agreeable solution. Research into problem-solving between partners is perhaps the most robust in terms of indicating the strong relationship between a couple’s problem-solving skills and the health of their intimate relationship. To the extent that you can effectively communicate around issues that divide you, problem solving will remain a relative strength in your relationship.  In negotiating topics of disagreement or conflict, it is very important for you both to stay engaged and be respectful of each other’s opinions.  It cannot be emphasized enough how important these characteristics are to a stable and satisfying relationship.   Couples who are skilled at providing each other with social support have been shown to be healthier and happier than less skilled couples. Social support skills are an important addition to problem-solving skills in maintaining optimal relationship health. Given what we know from the relationship literature, social support is an obvious strength that you can capitalize on as you face the inevitable stresses of life.',
		'Relationship research has found that the ability to share and use humor to alleviate tension and conflict is a strong predictor of long-term relationship health, and your strength in this area bodes well for your continued intimate connection. The sense of humor that you exhibit is indicative of a deeper, substantial, and close friendship that you maintain, which further serves as a source of strength in your relationship.  Couples research has found that the quality of a couple’s friendship is one of the strongest predictors of relationship well-being.  Partners who maintain a strong friendship have been shown to be more resilient to the ups and downs of day-to-day life.  The quality of a couple’s friendship has been shown to be perhaps the most basic element in the foundation of a healthy intimate relationship.  A sense of humor has been shown to be a tremendous asset to relationship health because it appears to aid in the communication of even difficult issues and to contribute to your sense of friendship and shared joy.',
		'Couples research has found that the quality of a couple’s friendship is one of the strongest predictors of relationship well-being. Partners who are good friends to each other have been shown to be more resilient to the ups and downs of day-to-day life. Friendship is rooted in trust, fun, shared interests and values, and perhaps most fundamentally, easy access to each other’s joy. Friends bring both light and laughter into each other’s lives, and the deep security of knowing you have each other’s back.   Research has shown that one major route to intimacy within romantic relationships is regular communication about the daily happenings of each partner’s separate life - a common quality of good friend\'s communication.   The quality of a couple’s friendship has been shown to be perhaps the most basic building block at the foundation of a healthy relationship.',
