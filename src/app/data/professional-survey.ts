		'Respect is an essential ingredient in a safe and healthy work environment.  Research has indicated that when employees feel respected, they are more likely to feel loyal to the organization and are less likely to seek employment elsewhere. Feeling respected is also correlated with your overall sense of well being at work.   Unfortunately, it is a common experience for co-workers to feel as though their opinions, actions, and choices are not respected. When a feeling of disrespect takes root in a working relationship, it can hurt everyone involved.  In addition to the potential damage to the relationship, a feeling of lack of respect can lead to detachment from the workplace and a desire to leave the company. We know from the research that experiencing incivility causes people to feel less satisfied with their job and ultimately leads to lost revenue at the organizational level. All of this tells us that when we don’t feel respected, we don’t feel safe being fully authentic and living up to our potential within our job.   While feelings of disrespect can arise from a myriad of circumstances, it is important to notice this process, catch it early, and set the intention to make changes before it does too much harm.',
		'Research has indicated that nearly all action in the workplace is driven by communication. That means that everything that we produce and everything that we are working toward hinges, in some way, on the way that we communicate with each other. It is therefore crucial to communicate well with your colleagues. Strong communication skills help to motivate employees and lead to higher levels of satisfaction and increased effectiveness.   When communication does not flow smoothly, however, it can lead to frustration, confusion, and even anguish. Whether communication is disorganized, unclear, or unkind it can affect every aspect of our work. Miscommunication can happen at any stage in the communication process, from text messages, work emails, in-person meetings, phone conversations, and even body language. It’s important to be aware that we are communicating with one another, even when we aren’t necessarily talking.   While miscommunication or poor communication can be incredibly challenging, it is also incredibly normative. In fact, we believe that miscommunication likely happens even more than clear communication. Learning how to come into relationship with our human tendency to miscommunicate can help us see our patterns and address our missteps with compassion, humor, and grace.',
		'Gossip can cause increased stress levels and psychological strain, which contributes to lower productivity and reduces your ability to effectively do your work. Research has demonstrated that workplace cliques can cause organizations as a whole to suffer due to lower levels of flexibility, reduced commitment, and poorer performance. Essentially, gossip and cliques can seem insignificant on the surface yet have a profound impact on the entire work community.   In addition, making contact with cliques can be deeply and personally painful. Sharing in community, laughing with coworkers, and making connections can be one of the most rewarding experiences at work. However, when we feel shut out, cut off, or on the outside of those relationships work can feel downright miserable. Researchers have found that the neurons that are activated when we feel isolated or excluded are the very same neurons that are activated when we feel physical pain. We are social creatures, and being on the outside of a clique can literally feel excruciating, whereas feeling included increases our commitment to and investment in the group.   Similarly, while conversing about people that you work with and care about is an incredibly normal pass-time, when we are the subject of these conversations, and especially when the content is less than desirable, we can feel hurt, insecure, and even betrayed.   There is a fine line between harmless office conversations and hurtful gossip, as is there a line between having preferences for whom to spend time with and actively excluding others. We want to stay on the healthy side of these lines so that everyone can feel cared about and included at work.',
		'Having anxiety about performing well at work is a common concern. One study conducted by the American Psychological Association revealed that more than one-third of working Americans report chronic work stress and only 37% of Americans state that they are doing well managing their stress. Anxiety in the workplace can negatively affect the health and safety of individual employees as well as entire organizations. Work anxiety and is linked to compromised immune systems, poor motivation, reduced productivity, and more absences.   Performance anxiety at work can be caused by many factors: lack of positive feedback, unobtainable goals, excessive demands, or an absence of managerial help. It’s amazing how impactful positive feedback can be – and how detrimental it is when feedback is overly critical, unclear, or even nonexistent.',
		'While research has shown that some level of competition is productive and leads to higher levels of motivation and interest, too much competition can be detrimental to workplace relationships. It has been found that a highly competitive environment is linked to negative outcomes such as prolonged distress, adverse behavioral reactions, and negative responses to failure.   It is important to remember that you and your co-workers are on the same team. When we can connect with our shared goals, we can more easily support our fellow teammates in their successes since their success is also ours.',
		'You can’t steal second base with your foot on first. At some point, you have to take a risk; it is part of business and it is part of life. Risk taking is an essential component to all of life. In fact, if you think about it, risk taking is at the heart of all playfulness, creativity, and fun. And that is why cultivating an environment in which people feel free to take calculated risk results in an organization that is creative, cutting-edge, and fun. And yet, many of us don’t feel safe or invited to take risks at work.  How safe we feel taking risks is often determined by the organization’s practices of giving feedback and maybe even punishing employees when the risk doesn’t pay off. These practices can lead to feelings of fear of losing one’s job or fear of negative feedback. However, often the best products, businesses, and ideas come from taking risks. Taking calculated risks can lead to innovation and increased company growth, and it is essential that employees feel comfortable pursuing ideas where outcomes are not guaranteed. Companies that foster intelligent risk-taking create a culture where employees feel encouraged taking on new challenges and stepping outside of their comfort zones. If employees are not penalized when creative ideas fail, they are more likely to pursue innovative paths that may lead to company success.     For example, the CEO of Extended Stay America has implemented a system of “Get Out of Jail, Free” cards, which employees can turn in when they take large risks that may not lead to favorable outcomes. Google famously let their developers take 20% of their time and just work on things they thought the company needed. Gmail, Google Maps, Adsense and more was built from that idea. They’ve since cut that program and their new product development is significantly down. According to Google, half of their products came from the 20% program. It’s important for employees and co-workers to feel safe taking risks. It’s also a great management tool. Encouraging someone to work on a riskier project after completing a specific task can help them complete that task more efficiently because they are rewarded with taking a risk they want.   Being able to move towards an environment where you feel safe taking at least some risks is important for your sense of well-being and your company’s capacity for success and growth.',
		'Life is busy. And work already takes up a good portion of our time every day, so finding time to interact with one another outside of work can be incredibly challenging. That being said, part of a good working relationship is having trust that your coworkers care about you and have your back. Interacting outside of work can help establish and strengthen this trust. Since you spend around eight hours a day with your coworkers, it’s important to everyone’s well-being for your relationships to be friendly. Socializing outside of work has numerous benefits. Researchers have found that workplace friendships allow coworkers to better understand each other and communicate more effectively, leading to enhanced well-being. These relationships are useful for personal career-building and decision-making support, and workplace friendships are also associated with higher levels of creativity and morale. Additionally, workplace socialization provides moral and material support, advice, information exchange, increased productivity and greater employee retention. If socializing is largely absent, there are several possibilities for improving socialization in the workplace and gaining these benefits.',
		'Not getting along well might not, in and of itself, be a problem. It might simply be a signal that you both fallen into a constricted and overly simplistic way of understanding each other (and even yourselves). We are least flexible and least able to be happy when we are stuck clinging to narrow views. However, it can feel incredibly challenging and even unbearable when you aren’t getting along well with your coworkers. When this pattern takes hold there is often an underlying issue or misunderstanding that needs to be discussed openly and addressed with empathy and kindness. If that is the case the important thing to do is identify the issue and address it openly, calmly, and respectfully. There’s usually a way through the issue whether it’s a conflict on a work decision, something someone said, or a feeling of a lack of respect. From this place we can more easily understand each other’s perspective and realize that it’s in everyone’s best interest to work through it.   These types of work conflicts can result from a general sense of incompatibility between individuals regarding their views, wishes, and desires. Disagreements can arise from either relationship conflict, in which the issue is rooted in personal characteristics, or task conflict, in which discord results from the task at hand. Both forms of conflict can negatively impact group outcomes by limiting the cohesion and efficiency of the group. Additionally, researchers have discovered that conflict results in a reduction of mutual understanding and goodwill, reducing a team’s ability to complete tasks. Conflict also has an impact on emotions and can cause individuals to become irritable and resentful, leading to poor outcomes. However, if managed more gracefully, conflict can have positive effects such as innovation and growth and even more connectedness.  As paradoxical as it may seem, conflict is often a source of growth and creativity if both people are willing to be authentic and humble – willing to both honor their own points of view while not clinging to those points of view.',
		'Conflict is a normal occurrence in relationship, and it is not so much conflict itself as how we repair and recover from conflict that determines the strength and resilience of an ongoing work relationship, and thus how creative and productive that relationship can be. However, sometimes, for various reasons, we can find ourselves in a moment where we are having a hard time recovering from a disagreement. These times can be particularly troubling because it can feel like we simply don’t have access to the part of us that wants to repair. We may feel powerfully justified in our hurt and anger and thus think we shouldn’t have to seek out or work on repair. We might feel overwhelmed or exhausted by the conflict, and that we simply don’t have the emotional energy to engage in the process of healing the relationship. Whatever the quality of the experience, it is a kind of constriction that in some ways creates more and more harm, to our own peace and to the emotional atmosphere of the entire team or organization.   A damaged work relationship has negative effects on performance and productivity when those involved must continue to coexist. A lack of recovery from disagreements tends to impact entire organizations and can negatively affect their functioning as well as the work environment as a whole. Our hurt and anger resonates throughout the atmosphere of the workplace and can be surprisingly contagious. Additionally, incivility in the workplace, which can result from disagreements, has been linked to increased aggression and harm to one’s organization and coworkers. For example, all workers in the office can be affected from simply witnessing the conflict, causing disruptions to cognitive resources, working memory, and overall performance. Researchers have determined that conflict between coworkers can continue to spiral and grow into increasingly aggressive behaviors and must be addressed to avoid further problems in the workplace. It is important to note that workplace disagreements require two parties, and therefore both members involved have an opportunity to diffuse the situation and return to a civil and cooperative arrangement. In other words, though it might take two to tango, in many instances it only takes one to begin the process of repair.',
		'Though not all differences in values or visions are necessarily problematic, there are numerous demonstrated benefits for a company united through shared values and a shared vision. Companies that lack this feature miss out on these positive results. For example, coworkers sharing the same values and vision develop trust, admiration, and respect towards one another. Coworkers are strongly motivated by having a clear sense of their shared values and vision, which creates loyalty to the organization as a whole. As a result, we tend to put forth greater effort to achieving goals. Additionally, coworkers who share values demonstrate more engaged behaviors, meaning that they are much more likely to go above and beyond to contribute to the success of the company. This willingness to work hard for the shared vision is often more beneficial than simply increasing productivity in one’s assigned role. Fortunately, there are several strategies that can be employed to create or reveal shared values and garner these benefits.',
		'The Dalai Lama encourages us to be kind whenever possible, and he says that it is always possible. Sometimes when we speak to each other in blunt and unkind ways we are simply not being thoughtful about our words and our tone. This lack of attention to how we communicate may seem like a small thing, but it can have significant consequences for our well-being and the well-being of the organization. It’s important to understand that things said, whether intended to or not, can have hurtful effects. Our words never go away; once it’s been said, it’s been said. Research has demonstrated that working in environments where people can be rude or disrespectful are linked to higher rates of anxiety, depression, and heart problems. Additionally, employees in these offices are less productive, make poorer decisions, and demonstrate lower levels of creativity. Furthermore, researchers have determined that rude behavior is “contagious” and leads those who experience a rude interaction to act less kindly themselves. Additional research has indicated that negative language featuring cynicism or disapproval can also result in poor outcomes for teams, such as increased pessimism and reduced customer satisfaction.  Luckily, there are several possibilities for improving these problematic patterns of communication and the entire office environment.',
		'Power differentials are an essential part of any workplace. It is not necessarily the existence of power differences that creates problems, as it is lack of transparency, clarity, and dialogue about power, as well as misuses of power. Clarity comes from fully owning one’s position in either the up-power or down-power position within the differential. In Cedar Barstow’s work on the Right Use of Power, she notes that legitimate power can be both over-used and under-used in ways that can undermine relationships of trust and productivity. When coworkers fall into negative power spirals, relationships can become strained and distrusting as each person becomes more reactive and defensive.',
		'Stress is an unfortunately common aspect of most jobs. People process and handle stress differently; there are healthy and unhealthy ways of coping with stress, and when it isn’t managed well it can feel like an unbearable burden. Stress can have numerous negative effects on both mental and physical health, including feelings of anxiety, depression, apathy, difficulty sleeping, headaches, and stomach problems. Additionally, long-term stress has been linked to high blood pressure, lowered immunity, and heart disease. Stress can also contribute to poor health behaviors like overeating, smoking, and drug or alcohol use.   One issue that can come up when colleagues are dealing with high levels of stress is unhealthy coping styles. Under stress, some coworkers may “clam up” and turn inward to deal with the situation, while others may lash out with their emotions. Neither of these patterns leaves people in a good place to communicate with and support each other in difficult times. Given these often natural, but unhelpful ways of coping, it is important to intentionally seek out effective and healthy methods for coping with stress in the workplace.',
		'We are all prone to becoming emotionally reactive when we are upset. However, we also all have a capacity to cultivate wiser and more skillful ways of responding even when we are very upset. Communicating our emotions is, for a variety of reasons, more challenging than communicating about tasks, goals, and projects. It is therefore an area that coworkers often struggle. Research has shown that perhaps the most destructive things that colleagues do are (1) criticize, (2) communicate contempt, (3) become overly defensive, and (4) prematurely withdraw from conversation. It is important to note that “withdraw” does not necessarily mean leaving, but can mean “taking a step back” emotionally because the topic seems like an invitation to unhealthy conflict or because the interaction has become emotionally flooding.  Being able to express emotions skillfully in the workplace is key for stress reduction, as it allows employees to gain support when facing difficult situations. Additionally, emotional expression has been linked to establishing psychological safety in organizations; when employees are open about both positive and negative emotions, this sets an emotionally safe climate for their coworkers. A workplace culture develops in part from the manner in which employees and supervisors discuss their emotions and reactions to events. Furthermore, expressing emotions can influence how employees perceive one another For example, individuals who express anger freely are often seen as tough and unsympathetic, while those who express guilt are perceived to be accepting and willing to make amends.   Communicating with each other about your emotions can be much like dancing a waltz.  You will inevitably step on each other’s toes from time to time and if you don’t communicate about the times you step on each other’s toes, you are inevitably going to keep stepping on each other’s toes.  This cycle of stepping on each other’s toes inevitably leads to toes getting sore, and the next slightest misstep can spark an emotional blowup.  The key to dancing more gracefully is regular communication about both the graceful moments and the occasional missteps. Saying “you know that hurts my feelings” although challenging in the short run, can avoid the every-6-month blowup. The problem with the 6-month blowup is that it can be so emotionally dramatic that you become less likely to give each other feedback in the moment for fear of triggering another dramatic blowup. By giving each other regular feedback about both the good moments and the occasional missteps, you will learn how to dance more gracefully together on a day-to-day basis and will make periodic blow-ups less and less likely.',
		'Conflict is contagious. If you pay attention, you’ll notice that when you are experiencing conflict anywhere in your life, it follows you as a kind of tension and prickliness in all other domains of life. Thus, it is quite natural for conflict at work to follow home and even into your sleep. The inability to get a good night’s sleep, while quite common, is one of the hardest challenges we face; the quality of our sleep affects nearly every aspect of our waking life. In addition, when work issues follow us home, causing tensions with our loved ones, it can feel as if there is no safe space to cope and process these conflicts. Research on job stress spillover has found that people are generally unaware of how much the stress from work follows them home.  If that is the case, then it helps to be more mindful that if things have been hard at work that day, then you may feel a little crankier at home about things that you normally would let roll off your back.  Knowing that can help you take some of the minor annoyances with a grain of salt.  Especially in times of transitions at work, it may help to recognize work/job stress as a chronic stressor for a while.  In doing so, you can recognize the importance of taking care of yourself and all of your relationships in a more gentle way.  Additional research has found that intense work demands or issues can harm family life as a result of fatigue and anxiety caused by the associated stress. Additionally, having an excessive focus on work can result in alienation from one’s family, family problems, and health concerns. An imbalance between work and home life can result in stress, prolonged sadness, alcohol or drug use, and spending less time with the people you care most about. This cycle then circles back to the workplace, as work-life balance stress has been shown to result in low morale, reduced productivity, and less job satisfaction. Being able to address challenges and conflicts that stem from the workplace, can help alleviate some of the negative side effects that arise at home.',
		'Giving and receiving feedback is among the most challenging type of interpersonal interactions. Feedback is always difficult to receive, even when given in the most skillful and positive way. It is our natural tendency to get at least a little bit defensive when we receive even small corrections. However, giving feedback to one another is arguably the fastest route to clarifying and shaping your needs, goals, and expectations. Given that – it is an essential aspect of workplace communication. That being said, it is a delicate and complicated process and one that is easily fumbled. The way that we give feedback has a significant impact on all aspects of our job, and when it is not done in a kind and respectful way it can leave both parties feeling hurt and unheard. Research has demonstrated that teams who give feedback in a positive way have better outcomes than those who engage in negative communication. When groups use speech that includes encouragement, support, and appreciation, they experience increased profitability and customer satisfaction. Teams who use negative language characterized by cynicism, sarcasm, and disapproval are much less likely to be successful on these measures. Further, teams that use positive language were found to produce more ideas and have a positive outlook, while teams that communicate negatively are less creative and more pessimistic. Feedback is crucial, and when it is done well, it benefits employees by providing them with support and information to help them maintain or improve their performance, but this benefit is washed away if the feedback is given in a harsh or rude manner. Learning how to give feedback in a kind way is just like learning any skill; it takes thoughtful attention and practice.',
		'Undermining can sometimes show up as a symptom of unhealthy competition. At other times, we can undermine each other unintentionally.  When undermining is unintentional it is often occurs as an unfortunate result of unexamined habit, work style, or even personality and is not necessarily meant to be aggressive or harmful. This type of undermining is usually most easily dealt with by simply clearly calling attention to the pattern and asking for more support and collaboration. On the other hand, undermining that has emerged from unhealthy competition is more potentially corrosive and may require taking a step back and identifying the presence of the unhealthy competition and resolving to reestablish an atmosphere of collaboration and shared goals. The research has demonstrated that undermining can be incredibly detrimental to the workplace and results in an inability to establish successful interpersonal relationships, reduced workplace success, and difficulty maintaining a positive reputation. Undermining could also potentially result in reduced organizational commitment, increased counterproductive behaviors, and even increased somatic complaints including headaches and other negative health outcomes. The goal is to move from undermining, which interferes with success, to active collaboration and trust.',
		'It has been said that the measure of our suffering is the distance between the way the world actually is and the way that we want it to be. And given that our vision for how we’d like the world to work, and the ways in which the world actually works are often quite different, our suffering in this spot can be great. It is not uncommon to set unrealistic expectations for yourself or your co-workers. Sometimes we hope that our co-worker will do more so that we can lighten our own workload, and other times it feels as if we have to carry the entire weight ourselves. Research has demonstrated that unrealistic expectations negatively impact both individuals and groups. In particular unfair expectations actually lead people to put in lower levels of effort at work, which reduces overall group productivity. Being able to recognize what is reasonable, realistic, and fair will help everything at work run more smoothly. It is also important to recognize that not everyone works in the same way. Some people can get more work done in one hour than others who work for half the day. Recognizing each person’s capacity and strengths, including your own, will allow you tailor your expectation to the individual and to the context.',
		'It is an uncomfortable, but not uncommon, experience to feel excluded at work. We can feel excluded in a variety of ways, from important meetings, influential decisions, and informal social situations. All types of perceived exclusion can be severely detrimental to trust, efficiency, transparency, and overall attitude. Social isolation has been linked to social anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and disengagement. Additionally, researchers have found that workplace exclusion leads to reduced employee commitment, decreased citizenship behavior, and increased levels of perceived unequal treatment. Exclusion also leads to reduced performance, problematic behaviors, and health issues. Furthermore, workplace exclusion has been shown to cause increased levels of absence due to sickness and higher employee turnover rates. Research has shown that we experience social exclusion in the same way that we experience actual physical pain – the same pathways in the brain are activated. In other words, exclusion is literally physically painful. Given all of these very real consequences, it is important to address feelings of exclusion as soon as they arise – and to take them quite seriously. No one wants to feel outside of important happenings, and there are many ways to open the workplace to an environment of inclusion rather than exclusion.',
		'Most jobs come with some inherent levels of stress – but when professional relationships become stressful everything is exponentially challenging. Unresolved conflicts, differences in personality, or diversity of work-styles may cause this stress. Stressful workplace relationships can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Workplace stress can lead to mental strain and cardiovascular disease over time. Research has indicated that coworker relationships are the biggest factor of health and longevity at work, even in comparison with the number of hours spent at the office or the disposition of your boss. As a result, stressful relationships with coworkers lead to a whole host of undesirable outcomes and therefore merit attention and open dialogue with everyone involved.',
		'It cannot be overstated how important it is to know that your voice is valued. Feeling that your perspective is heard, respected, and appreciated tends to increase your commitment to your organization, including feeling responsible for constructive change, having a sense of ownership over your work, and getting along with your team or work-group. Not feeling like your contributions and voice is valued at your workplace, on the other hand, can undermine your confidence and willingness to speak up and collaborate at work. While this is unfortunately a common issue, research has found that not feeling heard can result in reduced performance and diminished employee morale.  To compound things further, when employees do not speak up, the leadership remains unaware of issues that other colleagues notice, resulting in inaccurate information about company performance as well as an inability to make timely and well-informed decisions. Having a voice at work is also associated with having a caring climate characterized by prosocial behaviors like support and mentorship. Companies clearly suffer at the individual and organizational level in the absence of members feeling that their voices and opinions are valued and it is therefore crucial to address this concern as soon as it arises.',
		'Being discriminated against is perhaps one of the most painful experiences someone can endure at work. It is deeply hurtful and simply unacceptable. Workplace discrimination has a wide variety of negative effects ranging from reduced performance to mental and physical health concerns. Those who experience discrimination are more likely to have high blood pressure, heart disease, and worse self-assessed health outcomes. Discrimination is also linked to psychological distress and poor emotional health. Additionally, individuals facing discrimination often have lower job performance and emotionally withdraw from work. Entire companies can be affected by the discrimination of members, which leads to a less supportive working environment and reduced productivity. Further, discriminatory behavior hurts the entire energy and reputation of an organization. While discrimination is a serious matter, it is not hopeless. There are several things that can be done to address discrimination.',
		'Harassment has become a more and more significant concern for businesses, and healthy corporations are taking harassment increasingly seriously. All coworkers have the right to feel safe and have their inherent dignity respected at work at all times. Workplace harassment is highly detrimental and leads to negative effects including poor health outcomes and reduced productivity. Exposure to harassment has been linked to depression, emotional distress, poor physical health, and exhaustion. Harassment is also correlated with increased rates of absence due to sickness and cardiovascular disease incidence. Entire organizations are also negatively impacted by harassment as it is linked to higher rates of stress claims, increased turnover, and lower office morale.   While harassment has a serious and detrimental impact on work environments, once the behavior has stopped, it is possible to repair, heal, and move forward.  Identifying and addressing incidents of harassment is a courageous act that benefits not just yourself, but all others at your work. The goal is to ultimately improve the climate of the workplace for everybody.',
		'Being bullied or intimidated at work is a very stressful and upsetting experience and can often leave you feeling unsure of yourself and even physically ill. Workplace bullying is not uncommon and is becoming increasingly a top concern for employers who are interested in the long-term well being of their employees and their companies. Bullying at work fosters an unsafe working environment that leads to increased stress and negative effects for health as well as performance. Bullying leads to depression, burnout, aggression, and anxiety while also contributing to physical ailments like musculoskeletal complaints and increased sick leave. Furthermore, bullying has also been linked to suicidal thoughts and actions.   While bullying has a serious and detrimental impact on work environments, once the behavior has stopped, it is possible to repair, heal, and move forward.  Identifying and addressing incidents of bullying is a courageous act that benefits not just yourself, but all others at your work. The goal is to ultimately improve the climate of the workplace for everybody.',
		'Telle Whitney said, “diversity drives innovation. When we limit who can contribute, we in turn limit what problems we can solve.” Workplace diversity has many positive aspects when managed well and serve as a strength in an office. Researchers have discovered that diversity leads to positive effects on the bottom-line and allows employees to realize their full potential in situations where diversity is managed correctly. Demographically diverse employees provide a wide variety of perspectives, values, and backgrounds that ultimately increase a team’s cognitive resources and ability to solve complex problems. Additionally, research has found that diverse workplaces have increased marketing opportunities, recruitment, and business image. However, in situations where diversity is not valued, tensions can arise that lead to discrimination, lost productivity, and harm to the organization’s reputation. All the important benefits of diversity can be washed away if your differences are problematized rather than celebrated. It is therefore incredibly important to identify this issue and take immediate steps to address the tension. If dealt with gracefully, you can move forward in a way that capitalizes on your differences.'

		'Remember why you decided to work together or work for the same company in the first place. What first drew you to this work? What is it that you love and appreciate about this work and this place, and working with each other? Find a time to sit down together and reconnect with what made you passionate about this in the beginning. You can discuss why you initially decided to work together, what you saw in each other before the experience of disrespect, and what you like and admire about each other. And then from this place, you can explore what has changed. Tapping into the early part of your relationship can help to put in perspective some of the more intense emotions that arise when you feel disrespected; it can reconnect you to a time when things were less complicated and more hopeful and possibly shine light on your inherent respect for each other.',
		'Make an effort to infuse every piece of communication with compassion. When conversing, try to be aware of the details of your coworker’s life and connect empathetically by considering his or her perspective on the matter at hand.',
		'Recognizing that there may be hurtful gossip or cliques occurring is half the battle. Pay attention to the entire work community and see if you can start to identify potentially problematic patterns. We only have the opportunity to make change from a place of awareness. So the encouragement here is to slow down, zoom out, and notice when yourself or others may be caught in office gossip or cliques.',
		'Introducing meditation into the workplace can help decrease stress and anxiety. For example, mindfulness meditation has been shown to reduce stress levels and increase the ability to notice key information in the workplace.  The CEOs of companies including Aetna Inc., Whole Foods Market and Tupperware Brands have embraced meditation in the workplace as a way of improving performance. You can be more mindful by paying attention to simple activities like breathing, eating, or walking for several minutes, which can help you relax and has the added benefit of increasing your ability to focus on a single task without becoming distracted.',
		'If you can recognize the competitive pattern that you have fallen into with your co-workers, you will be better positioned to pause, see it for what it is, and take a step back. If you are simply unaware of it then you are caught in the tornado and it can be hard to tell up from down. Once you have a sense of what is happening then you can accept its existence, as competition is present in virtually all workplaces, and make clearer decisions about how, if at all, you want to use that competitive energy.',
		'Consider implementing a system like the “Get Out of Jail, Free” cards, or find a way to let everyone know that it is safe for them to take risks.',
		'Hosting parties and events with coworkers can allow you to socialize and increase your office network.',
		'Research has indicated that office environments characterized by open mindedness and cooperation leads groups to handle opposing views in a productive manner.  Try to foster this attitude by introducing voluntary mentorship relationships, implementing team-based performance reviews, engaging in purposeful conversations, and modeling strong relational collaboration.',
		'In the literature on repair, it is noted that repair doesn’t have to happen all at once. In fact, it is likely that cannot happen all at once. And so, we don’t move hurt and anger to forgiveness and repair in one step. However, the one step that we can take with mindfulness and attention is to simply set the intention that we will begin to move toward forgiveness and repair. Once that first step is in place, then seeking the help and circumstances that facilitate that repair becomes more available and more likely. If we would be an instrument of peace, where there is injury we must be willing to sow pardon. If you feel that you can have a repairing conversation with the other person, then that is a good first step. Sometimes multiple conversations are necessary, but being willing to stay in dialogue is the key attitude to cultivate.',
		'Create time for conversations about the mission of the company and how this is reflected in your everyday work. These conversations allow you and your coworkers to bond and align with your shared values and visions, and to discover new perspectives that you might wish to adopt as well.',
		'It is quite normal to feel defensive and reactive when someone has been unkind towards you. However, it is essential to your working relationships that you pause, take several deep breaths, and really consider your response before letting your words leave your mouth. People who are unkind may be trying to seek a reaction from you – set the intention to make it a thoughtful, calm, and kind reaction– regardless of how your coworker started the conversation. The grace with which you carry yourself is rooted in your own intention.',
		'Take time to sit down with your coworker and discuss the aspects of your relationship that lead you to feel that there is a negative power spiral. Having both parties discuss their needs, wishes, and emotions will open channels of communication that can transform into a positive power spiral. If it is difficult to have these conversations, precisely because of the power differential, then bringing in a skilled and neutral third party to mediate the conversation can be very helpful.',
		'Keep a record of the aspects of work that are stressful and the methods you use to cope. Review this regularly to determine the biggest triggers of stress and the best practices for reducing stress.',
		'Notice the dangerous communication pattern when it is occurring in your relationship. Be aware of the pattern and call it out—“We are entering into *our pattern* again.” You can even give it a name—call it “The trap”, or “cycle”, or even “hippopotamus" if you like.  This may help to create just enough distance between you and this pattern for you to be able to discuss the pattern together. The goals might be (1) to begin to recognize the signs of the negative interaction, before you are fully in it and (2) to signal that you need to do something proactive in that moment, in order to step out of the pattern.',
		'While we know it is nearly impossible to completely separate our work life from our home life, we can try setting some boundaries on when and how we work when we are home. For example, you might choose to not answer work emails after 7pm, or you might not check your messages until after you exercise or have dinner with your family. You might also create an “unwinding and connection” ritual for when you get home, that let’s you let go of the day and “fully arrive” home with intention and love. Having boundaries can be a healthy way to get the most out of both the work and home aspects of your life.',
		'When giving feedback, focus on coming together, shoulder to shoulder, to reach your goals and desired outcomes rather than attending to personal characteristics when giving feedback. This turns feedback into a collaborative problem solving situation rather than a character attack.',
		'Oftentimes the pattern of undermining stems from a lack of communication or a lack of clarity. In these instances it is important to identify the root cause so that you have a clear path towards addressing the issues. Sometimes the reason for undermining might be caused by something else.  Having open conversations discussing the “why” behind the undermining is important, and will help you understand the source of the pattern. Once you are able to recognize why the process is occurring, then you can start to brainstorm healthy solutions.',
		'Set up meetings dedicated to discussing each person’s expectations for the project and their individual goals. Consider conducting one-on-one meetings or distributing an online poll to all members to learn about their personal expectations for themselves and their coworkers. Check in often to tailor expectations to what you all discover about each other’s actual capacity.',
		'Exclusion and bullying often result from the organizational climate, and therefore employees benefit from statements from company leadership that directly oppose these issues. For example, management can create a statement of commitment to inclusion and acknowledgement of unhealthy patterns of behavior to demonstrate their stance against exclusion.',
		'Put yourself first when you feel stressed by your relationship, as you will be unable to fix the situation if you are not healthy enough to do so. Check in with yourself and know when to take a step back from the situation. Make your initial response to the stress one of compassion towards yourself. Perhaps you need a take a quick walk outside, make yourself a cup of tea, eat a snack, or call a loved-one. Practicing self-care is a wonderful way for you to practice relationship-care.',
		'Pema Chodron says, “deep down in the human spirit there is a reservoir of courage. It is always available, always waiting to be discovered.” While you may not feel particularly brave if your voice is not always valued at work, you can dig into this reservoir to speak up anyway. Tap into your value of sharing, collaboration, and forward thinking and continue to lean into situations that you may have started to shy away from. Essentially, try to let go of the outcome of sharing your voice (heard or unheard) and share for the sake of sharing.',
		'If you feel safe enough to do so, address the person or people who are acting discriminatory towards you. While it is absolutely no excuse for this problematic behavior, discrimination is often born from ignorance and it may be the case that the people involved are unaware of the ways in which they are discriminating against you and having this difficult conversation may provide them with an opportunity to learn and change their behavior, for your own sake and all future people who may experience discrimination in the same way.',
		'If you feel safe to do so, address the incident and behavior directly and specifically with the other person. Be clear that you experienced the incident as inappropriate and express how it made you feel; be clear that the behavior needs to stop and should the incident occur again, you will report it to a supervisor or the HR department.',
		'Exclusion and bullying often result from the organizational climate, and therefore employees benefit from statements from company leadership that directly oppose these issues. For example, management can create a statement of commitment to inclusion and acknowledgement of unhealthy patterns of behavior to demonstrate their stance against exclusion.',
		'One way of addressing problematic ways of interacting with diversity at work is to turn towards more diversity, rather than dwelling on any rifts that have been created. When you try to diminish something, it can actually amplify the issue. Rather, try embracing all kinds of diversity at work. You can reorganize groups to interface with a more diverse set of individuals, reframe your outlook when meeting new people, and seek to appreciate differences that all individuals bring. Create ways of celebrating diversity in the workplace and communicate clearly to all employees leadership’s commitment to the value of diversity.'

		'Initiatives like Civility, Respect, and Engagement in the Workforce (CREW) have been developed to combat disrespect, and these programs are based on weekly meetings with a facilitator to set goals and increase teamwork. Consider implementing similar meetings at your workplace to check in with one another, engage in an open dialogue, and compassionately discuss your concerns.',
		'Even more useful than Stop, Drop, and Roll. Before you engage in conversation about a sensitive or important topic, take a moment to pause and consider how you will address the issue with each other. Rather than rushing into your agenda, ask open-ended questions about the topic, and allow both of you an opportunity to respond without interrupting one another. While your colleague is speaking, try to actively listen instead of planning what you will say next. Even if you believe you already know the information being shared, providing space for others to speak will in turn make them more receptive to the information you are giving. Engaging in active conversation in which you both are able to speak freely will promote a stronger and healthier relationship, which we know can have a positive affect on all aspects of your job.',
		'One way to combat cliques and gossip is to practice inclusion into group activities and conversations. Close friendships are wonderful if harnessed effectively, and knowing that close behavior between a few could be negatively affecting others can result in a natural desire for inclusion. The idea here is bringing people together, helping everyone feel wanted, and especially inviting those who may feel left out to join the fun. Keep your eyes open for people who seem alone or excluded and go out of your way to invite and include them – a sort of “no one eats lunch alone” policy.',
		'Programs that emphasize increased hopefulness will likely reduce job anxiety.  Researchers have also found that hope allows us to continue to move forward and actively pursue our goals even in the face of adversity. For example, setting aside time to connect and discuss the future of the company in a positive manner or brainstorm new ideas could increase hopefulness and lead to a healthier workplace.',
		'Striking the ideal level of competition is key for a successful workplace, and it is recommended that workplaces foster an environment that emphasizes collaboration rather than competition. Workplaces can create a collaborative environment by forming non-hierarchical project teams, uniting employees through a shared vision, and shifting to a leadership style that is more fluid and flexible based on the context and people at work.',
		'Meditation teacher, Pema Chodron, says “failing better means when failures happen in your life, they become a source of growth, a source of moving forward, a source of rawness where you can really communicate genuinely with other people. Your best qualities come out of that place, because it is unguarded and you’re not shielding yourself. Failing better means that failure becomes a rich and fertile ground.”  So if a risk does not pay off, we can use the situation as an opportunity to learn from what did not work and move forward. Do not get stuck on this perceived failure, and instead apply the lessons learned to future experiences.',
		'Create opportunities to bond and discuss non-work related topics over meal. This can be 30 minutes in a break room – or scheduling a longer lunch where you eat in a park or go to a restaurant. Carving out time to enjoy a meal together can bolster your connection and make your working relationship more enjoyable.',
		'Be thoughtful when giving feedback to a coworker by making the goal of the conversation clear and acting with compassion. Having open and honest conversations is key to reducing office conflict.',
		'It is difficult to make rational decisions when frustrated or upset, and you should refrain from making important decisions during an argument or while you are still under the influence of strong emotional upset. It is easy to make destructive decisions for the organization when motivated by hurt and anger. Instead, wait until all those involved have returned to calm and openness to collaboration before making important decisions.',
		'When considering next steps for your own work or for the organization, take time to discuss your vision and the visions of others in a group setting. Listening to the ideas of others creates an opportunity to forge a shared vision for the company’s future.',
		'Relationship Researcher John Gottman found that the way we start conversations is the way they typically end. Given this – it is important that you take the lead on opening communication in a gentle, thoughtful, and most importantly, kind way. That initial interaction can have a profound impact on the way the rest of your interactions unfold.',
		'Rather than trying to change the behavior of your coworker, determine how you can alter your actions to improve the situation. Consider what options you have for improving the relationship and enact those that will have the largest impact on the situation.',
		'Being healthy greatly improves your ability to cope with stress. Be diligent about getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, getting plenty of exercise, and avoiding excessive alcohol intake. When we’re stressed, these self-care activities can seem like a luxury that we cannot afford, however, “keeping the axe sharp” is the key to success and happiness.',
		'Have a brainstorming session together, when both of you are feeling comfortable and balanced, to generate ideas for what to do when you feel your unhealthy emotions are about to happen or already occurring. This may include something as basic as an agreed-on hand signal to indicate you are feeling overwhelmed and need some time and space to gather your feelings. It may also include coming up with phrases or things to say to each other that will have a calming effect, or at the very least do not irritate or aggravate the other.',
		'One thing that we often do in response to conflict is throwing ourselves into our work. While this might seem like a helpful strategy in some ways, it can ultimately be quite draining. So instead, try to take time to step away and take short breaks between tasks to recharge. It may seem counterintuitive, but actually taking time to rest has been shown to improve your efficiency and productivity at work, which in turn can help reduce the stress that follows you home.',
		'Feedback is more effective when given often rather than being relegated to one or two sessions per year. Individuals are likely more nervous during official performance reviews, which makes it a poor time to give negative feedback. Aim to praise employees as often as the thought occurs to you and give constructive feedback within 24 hours of the event.',
		'Try shifting your stance from one of competition to one of shared goals and values. Identifying these shared values will help you feel like more of a team and be inherently more interested in working to lift each other up and achieve success together as partners.',
		'Try to keep information flowing openly between members so that everyone can discuss their progress on the task at hand and how they are feeling about their role, which will circumvent issues surrounding unfair work distribution. Establish clear and straightforward procedures to ensure that all group members are aware of what is expected of them and others. This will prevent confusion and frustration and provide guidance for handling situations in which an individual does not put in sufficient effort.',
		'Creating a culture in which unique attributes of employees are valued can foster a sense of belonging more effectively than trying to minimize differences. Erasing differences can blind you to the members of the organization that are missing from a project or group, such as female or minority employees. Therefore it is essential to recognize and wholeheartedly embrace a unique and diverse presence in all aspects of your work.',
		'Do not expect unreasonable levels of productivity or effort from yourself or your coworker. Try to recognize when your expectations may be adding to your level of stress and try to support each other rather than put excess pressure on yourselves and your relationship.',
		'It is easy to feel alone when you aren’t necessarily encouraged for your perspective and voice. See if you can find someone that you work with to share these feelings with. Maybe another colleague or a supervisor or boss. Let at least one trusted person know what you have been experiencing. This may allow for a safe support system, or even a chance to practice bringing this up with the people who have dismissed your perspective before.',
		'It is so important to be extra compassionate towards yourself if you are experiencing discrimination at work. Here are some practical ways that you can take care of yourself during this challenging time.   - Focus on strengths Find motivation to succeed and overcome by focusing on your values, beliefs, and strengths. Recognize your resilience and ability to cope with challenges, present and future.   - Connect with others Seek support and connect with others who have faced similar situations. Discrimination can lead individuals to internalize negative beliefs and feel that they are not good enough, but this can be combatted with a strong support system.   - Move forward Although it can be very difficult to move forward from an instance of discrimination, try not to dwell too long on the experience. Instead, take action and speak with others or make a plan for how to cope with discrimination if it happens again.',
		'While some issues can be resolved with a simple conversation, other instances are more complicated and requite additional support. In these cases, it is important to seek outside help and potentially report inappropriate or harassment behavior to your supervisor or Human Resources department. When brining this up to co-workers, superiors, or HR it’s very important to have tangible examples. The clearer your examples are, the clearer the response can be.',
		'Your instinct might be to try to win the favor of someone who is bullying you, but this often results in reinforcing the bullying behavior. Therefore, do not give favors or try to befriend those who bully you in hopes that they will stop, and instead try directly addressing the issue.',
		'Acknowledge that you and your coworkers each have their own unique strengths that allow the company to work well. If we all had exactly the same ideas, we would never innovate or be balanced in our perspective. The different complex histories that each person has can be seen as a beautiful asset, both to your relationships and to your work.'

		'Consider implementing a workplace policy of kindness. Some companies have addressed issues with respect by implementing policies that state that demonstrations of disrespect (office politics, talking down to others, passive aggressive comments, invading private spaces, etc.) will not be tolerated and that demonstrations of respect will be rewarded. Creating a company culture of civility will make it clear to colleagues that they are expected to engage with one another respectfully. This can help to set a standard of kindness, esteem, and safety at work.',
		'It is important to ask clarifying questions if you are unsure what your colleague is talking about. Having a strong grasp of the situation will allow you to better contribute to the conversation. We encourage you to push passed any worry or embarrassment that might arise when asking questions, it demonstrates that you are engaged and interested in the topic being discussed. Begin with “who, what, where, when, why, and how” questions that address the area in need of clarification. Asking questions improves dialogue and can reveal problems around the topic that could have been overlooked otherwise.',
		'While we believe relationships are actually one of the most important aspects of work, it is important to recognize the difference between maintaining friendships and becoming caught up in drama. By keeping your focus on positive, present-moment, and productive aspects of both work and relationships, you will be able to keep your distance from the more harmful patterns (dwelling on the past, speculating about the future, exaggerating experiences, etc.) that can lead to gossip and cliques.',
		'Try establishing work-life boundaries to allow yourself time to de-stress. Recharging through activities that you enjoy will reduce anxiety and allow you to return to work feeling recharged.',
		'Setting personal goals motivates people without creating an intense and overly-competitive environment. Instead of competing against coworkers, consider setting specific performance goals for yourself. Research has demonstrated that setting personal goals leads to improved task performance and self-efficacy.  Additionally, coworkers can work together to set their personal goals, which will turn this practice into a healthy outlet for competitive energy and lead people to set higher goals.',
		'Researchers have found that mentors help people acclimate to the company culture. In this case, mentors could create an environment where taking risks is encouraged and potential missteps are not penalized.',
		'Consider creating a space in the office with relevant books and learning materials, which will allow people to come together and discuss what they have been reading and talk about work in a less structured manner. You might also take turns leading a brief discussion where you have the opportunity to teach each other different aspects of your expertise.',
		'Work to be aware of your actions that can contribute to problems in the workplace and aim to alter these behaviors. Rather than struggling to change a problematic behavior of a coworker, begin with transforming your own choices to improve the work environment.',
		'One of the best ways to move past an unresolved disagreement is to enter conversation about the disagreement again, try to thoroughly understand each other’s perspectives, and try to solve the issue from the perspective of that more thorough understanding. If there’s been a good amount of time and the disagreement is still causing issues you’ve probably had time to process the issue, the other person’s perspective, and rethink your own position and opinions. Revisiting the issue might be more productive now than it was previously. Remember that there’s always a middle ground.',
		'Coworkers feel like they are striving towards a shared goal when the organization is transparent about the shared mission and when the connection between tasks and that vision is clear. When coworkers are able to answer why they are doing their work, they feel like more of a team and perform better overall. Consider your own motivations for working and discuss how these align with your coworkers’ sources of drive.',
		'Try to see the interaction with your coworker from his/her perspective. Imagine what it might be like to be in their shoes and take some time to zoom out – and get a broader perspective on the situation.',
		'Redirect conversations with your coworker from past transgressions to future operations and actions. All issues between coworkers have occurred in the past, but the resolution to these concerns only exists in the future. Discuss how you can act differently or plan to change behaviors moving forward without dwelling on past issues.',
		'It can be important in the domain of work stress to use each other as social support. You may each need time to vent about your work stress and want the other to support you. While this will not always be possible, because the other may be under his/her own deal of immense stress, our recommendation is for you both to agree to set aside a little bit of time to talk about your stress with each other and to provide one another with emotional support, validation, and, to the degree that it is requested, problem solving. Then, after the agreed amount of time, switch your attention back to your goals and tasks at work.',
		'Rather than opening up to all coworkers at once try to connect with one or two colleagues that you are comfortable with. Having relationships with a few coworkers will give you a space to share your feelings without necessarily feeling the need to communicate them to the entire organization.',
		'Having support from family and other coworkers is a tremendous benefit and will make it easier to communicate about conflicts and balance work and life more effectively. We are often reluctant to use our support system because we don’t want to bother anyone with our troubles, but it can be incredibly cathartic to talk to people who care about you and chances are they will be delighted to be there for you.',
		'Base feedback in concrete evidence about the recipient’s actions or behavior rather than giving vague information.

As a manager or coworker, part of your job is to support your coworkers in a way that helps everyone obtain success.

You might propose that each person in the meeting be asked his/her opinion about major decisions, or that your boss hold open office hours to hear the voices of even the more shy employees, or that all ideas be written on a white board so that they are equally considered.

We know that this does not necessarily change your own experience of feeling disrespected, but shifting your focus to modeling and spreading respect throughout the workplace can have a measurable positive affect on everyone’s well being, including your own.',
		'Once you feel like you have a good sense of the issue, reflect your understanding to your coworker. Make sure that your perspective aligns with his/her perspective. Miscommunication often occurs when people believe they are on the same page, and they are in fact writing completely separate books. You can reflect in the moment and after the information from your discussion has had a chance to set it.  Along these lines, it can be helpful to recap meetings with an email so everyone can make sure that they are in fact on the same page.',
		'Internal Gossip happens when people feel like they can’t express opinions openly. Internal Cliques happen when employees feel like their opinions aren’t heard so they team up together. Creating a structure that allows for all voices to be valued can effectively stop this pattern at the source. One way to create a healthy structure is to implement and utilize team-building activities and team projects that pull members from different social groups together.',

Once a week, make a note of telling someone something good that they did. This can be a quick email, a sticky note, a text-message, or even an in-person comment. You’ll be surprised how shifting your attention and awareness to positive events at work can create a little extra space between you and your anxiety.

You can join a social sport league, challenge some friends to a 2v2 best ball golf, go bowling after work, or make a regular trivia or board game night. Being competitive can be fun and even growth promoting in your relationships, it is just important to view these activities lightly, playfully, and kindly. Pulling that energy out of the often more serious working environment and using it to infuse your down-time might create just the right balance for competition and collaboration, and allow you to view your working relationships with a more team-oriented perspective.',

Sharing your interests with your coworkers can positively impact your relationship. So whether you play a musical instrument, know a lot about space, are an expert basket weaver, or teach yoga on the side – share that passion with the people you work with so that you can start to join around the non-work things that really matter to you.',
		'Let’s be honest. We can’t always get along with everyone. Sometimes this type of situation calls for radical acceptance. Once you fully accept that you won’t be close with everyone, and let go of the struggle of trying to force it to be otherwise, you might find that there is more space for your relationship to emerge in a more natural and authentic way. If you find that there’s a deeper issue, like fundamentally not getting along, it may ultimately be necessary to find ways to clearly define roles to address any potential areas of conflict (and how to manage them) ahead of time. It might not be a problem that you rub each other the wrong way. Even that can be held with humor and compassion.',
		'If the misunderstanding is simply too challenging to work through together, then reaching out to a mediator/facilitator can be very helpful. Consider asking a supervisor or neutral peer for their input on the situation. It can also be helpful to bring in a professional mediator who has training in helping people resolve unresolved disagreements. Having the perspective of an unbiased party can break a stalemate between those disagreeing and allow those involved to better communicate.',
		'Having different values and vision can be a fundamental problem for co-workers and cause a fracture if not addressed. It can be very important to have the same long-term vision for a company. The short-term vision will change as you go if you’re a start-up. It can be easier to agree on the long-term vision and work backwards. Practice creating a few “if-then” statements; this can make everyone feel heard while still getting the vision down on paper. For example, “if we are going to accomplish the big vision, then what do we have to accomplish first?” Creating these kinds of if-then statements for any sized company when talking about your vision can help clarify your overall shared approach.',

		'Power differences in business are important to keep things running efficiently, but these can often cause challenges to ego. A person in a position of power needs to know when and how to use their power wisely. It’s important to get honest feedback from people in the down power position; wielding your up power without grace and wisdom can lead to coworkers feeling afraid to speak up and contribute. This can cause a host of coworker problems and also business problems.

Being aware of this stress pattern can help you see more clearly the unnecessary source of some of your tension (versus the simply unavoidable sources). It is also helpful to be clear with each other when you are experiencing stress.  If you find that you are having difficulty “letting go” of worries about work, consider acquiring and listening to a podcast on mindfulness, such as Jon Kabat Zinn’s, “Mindfulness for Beginners” series, or downloading a mindfulness app such as Headspace, Calm, Mindbody, or the Mindfulness App. The goal here is to learn and practice how to meet stress in the body and mind in a way that creates spaciousness and stability. It is possible to experience the inevitable stresses of life without actually suffering from stress.',

If you committed to something that is causing you stress and conflict evaluate if it would be possible to step away from that role. If someone is asking you to take on a task that doesn’t sound fun or beneficial, see if there might be room for a tactful “no thank you.” And if you have a mountain of work, see if there might be other valuable team-members who would be willing to share some of the load.',
		'Relationship Researcher, John Gottman, found that the way we start conversations is the way they typically end. Given this – it is important that you take the lead on starting your feedback in a gentle, thoughtful, and, most importantly, kind way.

		'Figuring out the source of the stress is one of the most effective ways to address the issue. The source of stress may be related to respect, vision, communication, role, expectations, or personal hurts. These can all be addressed once you name what the source of tension is.

		'One way to provide feedback is to start and end with something that you genuinely appreciate about the other person. Essentially two good pieces of feedback sandwiching the constructive feedback. This leaves the person receiving the feedback feeling overall positive, but with a something concrete they can work on.

While it is not always our instinct, it is immensely beneficial if we direct our own minds to focus on what we are grateful for in our co-workers, and then use feedback sessions as opportunities to share the wonderful aspects as well as the growth edges.

		'“Problems are nothing but wake-up calls for creativity” --- Gerhard Gschwantner  Being able to solve problems well together is essential to the success of any shared endeavor.  It leads to better, more creative solutions, maximizes productivity, and genuinely makes work more fun. Solving problems well together not only helps your work-life run more smoothly, it also nurtures the foundation of your working relationship and makes working together both rewarding and enjoyable. Research has shown that teams who manage conflicts well are more creative, report better performance, and have improved decision-making abilities. These benefits are, in part, due to individuals feeling safe and confident to express differing ideas and opinions openly within work environment. Group problem solving ability is correlated with higher levels of emotional intelligence. In addition, managing conflicts constructively is linked to strong team and organizational performance. Solving problems well together is an essential strength and will benefit all areas of your shared work. This strength can be utilized as a resource in times of stress and force multiplier when things are going well.',
		'“The quality of your communication is the quality of your life.” --- Anthony Robbins  The mission and goal of an organization is at the heart of success. Partners who can communicate clearly about their mission and goals are at a tremendous advantage and can leverage that shared understanding to achieve even greater levels of success. Communicating clearly about your shared mission and goals establishes a strong working relationship and helps you bring out each other’s best selves to achieve your shared vision. Research has demonstrated that organizations that focus on fostering strong relationships and creating communities of practice around shared goals have higher social capital, which positively impacts business performance. Groups that form around a shared interest or goal are able to better learn from each other, work more confidently on assignments, and work together to solve common problems in the organization. We know that the way that we communicate within our working relationships affects all other aspects of the organization, so being clear, kind, and encouraging with one another is a core strength that will serve you well as you continue to partner towards success.',
		'“Probably no greater honor can come to any man than the respect of his colleagues.” --- Cary Grant  Being respectful towards one another is a sign of maturity, compassion, and interpersonal skillfulness, and it is essential for creating healthy work relationships. Research has found that people who treat coworkers with civility are more likely to be viewed as leaders and perceived as warm and confident. Additionally, research has demonstrated that workplaces characterized by respect and civility have an improved safety climate and, interestingly, a reduced number of workplace injuries. Employees who work in respectful environments also report increased job satisfaction and feelings of empowerment. The respect that you have for one another is an essential and important strength. The way that you treat each other will not only keep your relationship healthy and bolster your productivity; it will serve as a healthy model for all the people you work with.',
		'“We didn’t even realize we were making memories, we just knew we were having fun.” --- Winnie the Pooh   Congratulations! You like each other! This may seem like a simple thing, but it is actually incredibly important and unfortunately rare. Researchers have found that workplace friendships allow coworkers to better understand each other and communicate more effectively, leading to improvements in all areas of work. Affable relationships are useful for personal career-building, decision-making support, and are also associated with higher levels of creativity and morale. Additionally, workplace socialization provides moral and material support, advice, and information exchange, in addition to increased productivity and employee retention. Your friendship is a tremendous strength and can help you weather the storms of inevitable stressful times and help you to enjoy and celebrate your achievements and successes.',
		'“It is not happy people who are grateful. It is grateful people who are happy.”  Being able to notice what is going well and put words on positive experiences is a rare and healthy practice. Gratitude practices have been associated with lower rates of workplace burnout, and coworkers who express gratitude in workplace interactions report higher rates of job satisfaction. Additionally, gratitude is positively correlated with corporate social responsibility, which has been linked to higher levels of motivation and commitment among employees. Letting each other know when you are feeling grateful or happy is a real strength with real measurable benefits, and one that can help you feel more connected to each other and the work that you are doing.',
		'“The more you celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate.” --- Oprah Winfrey  Celebrating successes is a key to even more success. Sometimes we can be so focused on the next challenge, that we can neglect celebrating the successes we have earned. This practice can help bridge us through periods of monotony or even failure. Being able to recognize and savor the wins is an important and growth-promoting skill. Researchers have found that employees who put in effort without enough reward are more likely to have poor health, so it is essential to provide opportunities for celebrating successes and acknowledging the efforts of others. Providing rewards for effort can reduce the effort-reward imbalance, which will positively impact physical health outcomes and increase job well-being. Additionally, celebrations contribute to the development of a strong organizational culture, in turn uniting coworkers and reinforcing the identity and mission of the office. Your capacity for celebration is paramount to the health of your long-term relationship and overall work success.',
		'“Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” – Victor Barge  Laughter really is the best medicine. Having fun in the workplace has been shown to produce a host of benefits, including higher levels of job satisfaction, lower rates of emotional exhaustion, and reduced turnover rates. Researchers have proposed that having fun leads to positive outcomes because it provides an enjoyable social structure in the workplace and allows employees to recover from inevitable stress. Additionally, fun in the workplace is more likely to attract job applicants than compensation or advancement opportunities. Recognizing that it is a balance, and infusing fun into periods of seriousness is immensely important. Having a safe and strong relationship that not only has space for, but also encourages laughter, silliness, and playfulness is a tremendous strength and will serve you well as you continue to work together.',
		'“Creativity is intelligence having fun” – Albert Einstein.   The courage to be creative and encourage the creativity of others is an essential strength both in and out of work. Creativity in the workplace has been linked to organizational innovation, effectiveness, and survival. Being creative allows workers to thrive in changing environments, react to challenges, and take companies in new directions.  In addition, recent research has discovered that teams who work well together on creative endeavors report stronger shared goals and enhanced socializing. Creativity is vital and your capacity to share your innovative ideas and grow together in your work is an indication of a strong and healthy relationship.',
		'“Diversity drives innovation. When we limit who can contribute, we in turn limit what problems we can solve” --- Telle Whitney.   There are numerous benefits associated with workplace diversity, ranging from increased creativity to higher levels of productivity. Researchers have discovered that diversity allows employees to realize their full potential in situations where diversity is managed correctly. Demographically diverse employees provide a wide variety of perspectives, values, and backgrounds that ultimately increases a team’s cognitive resources and ability to solve complex problems. Additionally, research has found that diverse workplaces have increased marketing opportunities, recruitment, business image, and overall success. Being able to celebrate your diversity and capitalize on your different backgrounds and perspectives is a tremendous strength that can lead both to a greater connection between the two of you and to a happier and healthier work environment.',
		'“Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” --- Helen Keller  It’s all about balance, the yin and yang. Research has demonstrated that possessing different strengths allows coworkers to work more effectively and provide different perspectives on the task at hand. Partnerships based on unique strengths are beneficial because one employee may have a strength where another possesses a vulnerability, creating a “whole that is greater than the sum of its individual parts.” Additionally, collaboration between those with distinct strengths provides an opportunity to see problems holistically rather than from a singular perspective.  Partners with different areas of strength, like you, have the ability to transform their organization as a result of their diverse methods and backgrounds.',
		'“An arch consists of two weaknesses, which, leaning on each other, become a strength.” --- Leonardo Da Vinci  We all need someone we can confide in, and having someone like that at work is a true gift. A study that measured the relationship between confiding and well-being found that employees who asserted that they are able to confide in others at work had higher levels of well-being. Well-being, in turn, is a predictor of good physical health and longevity. Additional research found that social support behaviors, such as confiding, have a positive impact on employees’ attitudes towards work, job satisfaction, and cohesion among coworkers. It has also been found that confiding allows coworkers to form social ties that are immensely helpful in uniting the workplace, particularly during times of organizational change.  Your ability to turn to one another when you need to talk is an indicator of strong friendship, respect, and trust.',
		'“The creative process is a process of surrender, not control.” --- Julia Cameron  Creating a network for sharing advice is essential for successful problem solving and learning. When coworkers share advice openly, employees are able to seek help when they are struggling to solve problems and can share the information that they possess. Strong advice networks have been linked to increased employee well-being, job satisfaction, and organizational performance. Employees also gain confidence through advice networks, and the support enables them to take on challenging work and create a positive cycle in which advice is exchanged freely rather than one partner giving advice and the other receiving. Your openness and willingness to engage in this collaborative process of giving and receiving advice demonstrates maturity and respect for one another. This strength will not only serve you both well as you continue to work together, but will also serve as a valuable model for others. ',
		'“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” –Winston Churchill  Taking risks can lead to innovation and increased company growth, and it is essential that employees feel comfortable providing new ideas in situations where outcomes are not guaranteed. The willingness to take risks is context-dependent and can vary in accordance with risk perception and the level of control one has over the outcomes. In other words, feeling safe in your environment and within your work relationship will provide a strong platform for your voice and original ideas.  Companies that foster intelligent risk-taking create a culture where employees feel comfortable taking on new challenges and stepping outside of their comfort zones. If employees are not penalized for creative ideas that fail, they are more likely to pursue innovative paths that may lead to company success. You have clearly fostered this sense of safety within your own work relationship and it will serve all aspects of your partnership and your work.',
		'“Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.” --- Charles Swindall  Having a positive attitude reduces stress and risks of heart disease and has been proven to strengthen your immune system and even lengthen your lifespan. So, it’s kind of a big deal.  Employees who have a positive attitude towards their work engage in better decision-making, and this disposition is also correlated with success and well being. A good attitude leads employees to increase the number of options they perceive in a situation, to be more open when problem solving, and to possess increased energy when adjusting to new environments. Researchers have found that employees who possess greater hope, efficacy, optimism, and resilience, have better behaviors in the workplace. Specifically, these workers are more engaged, less cynical, have greater awareness, and are less likely to negatively impact the organization through deviant behaviors. Additional research that focused on team dynamics found that groups who were positive about their work, characterized by encouragement and appreciation, had better outcomes than those who engaged in negative behaviors like cynicism and sarcasm. Your capacity to see the bright side in your work and in each other is a tremendous strength that will serve you both well as you continue your working relationships.',
		'“No one is more cherished in this world than someone who lightens the burden of another.” --- Joseph Addison  It has become clear that one’s life is not cleanly divided into work and personal life, and life experiences “spill over” into work, which can cause stress if not addressed properly. It is therefore important to have relationships in the workplace in which employees are comfortable sharing details about their lives and receiving support from one another. If stresses from everyday life are properly addressed in the workplace, workers’ experience improved physical and emotional outcomes as a result of reduced stress. Additionally, this support and associated open communication allows employees to exchange work-related information more freely, leading to an improved communication network throughout the office. Your support for one another outside of work demonstrates that you truly care about each other and indicates that your friendship is strong. This type of relationship can add significant joy to your life and help you to be more resilient in times of stress.',
		'“No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted” – Aesop.   Research has demonstrated that teams who give feedback in a positive way have better outcomes than those who engage in negative communication. When groups use speech that includes encouragement, support, and appreciation, they also experience increased profitability and customer satisfaction. Teams who use negative language characterized by cynicism, sarcasm, and disapproval are much less likely to be successful on these measures. Further, teams who use positive language were found to produce more ideas and have a positive outlook, while teams that communicate negatively are less creative and more pessimistic. We know that feedback benefits employees as it provides them with support and information to help them maintain or improve their performance, and being able to deliver that essential information in a kind and gentle way is paramount to maintaining your relationship and improving the quality of the work that you do.',
		'“Authenticity is not something we have or don’t have. It’s a practice, a conscious choice of how we want to live” --- Brene Brown.   Authenticity in the workplace has been linked to higher levels of well-being in several studies. Researchers have found that being able to express one’s personality and values leads to lower rates of anxiousness, depression, and distress. Being authentic has also been shown to help people achieve their goals and increase well being when they succeed. This research also asserts that self-expression in the workplace can positively impact well being when employees are completing tasks that feel meaningful. Creating an environment characterized by self-expression improves the attitude of the entire office and leads to happier and healthier employees. You two have proven that your relationship is a safe space to be vulnerable and an inviting environment for authenticity. This demonstrates a tremendous strength and nurturing space for growth and connection.',
		'“To move forward, you have to give back” --- Oprah Winfrey.   Being a part of an organization that cares about positively impacting their community is a wonderful thing. Companies that engage in socially responsible behaviors like community service, experience several positive benefits for both employees and the organization as a whole. Research has demonstrated that employees who volunteer on behalf of their company feel more proud of their organizational membership, which leads them to further identify as part of the company and increases intentions to stay. Additionally, these employees are increasingly loyal to the company and often repay the organization through increased performance. These volunteer programs promote a sense of “oneness” between the employee and the organization, which motivates employees to engage in behaviors that assist the organization in achieving objectives. Furthermore, socially responsible activities give employees a sense of meaning and purpose at work. Your sense of pride for your company is absolutely warranted, and being able to recognize this strength will serve you well as you continue to make an impact in the world.',
		'“Fall down 7 times, stand up 8” --- Japanese Proverb  The ability to keep moving forward in the face of failure allows people to learn, grow, and gain confidence. In this mindset, employees are more likely to feel hopeful and optimistic rather than ashamed of their failures. When handled well, failure can result in a realignment process that causes individuals to accurately evaluate their self-perceived versus actual abilities, allowing them to gain knowledge about their personal strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately, this realignment experience leads to an increased sense of self-awareness that has been found to contribute to future success. Failure has been shown to cause people to reassess their personal values, as self-esteem can mutate from being based on external rewards to one’s own beliefs and ideals. Additionally, moving beyond failure leads to greater freedom in the workplace because employees tend to realize that others are not as judgmental and unsympathetic as previously believed and that life continues on. Your encouragement of each other in these places demonstrates a significant strength and will help you to flourish in your workplace.',
		'“The Mystery of the human experience lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.”  - Fyodor Dostoyevsky.   Purpose in the workplace allows individuals to remain in the present and perform at their best. Researchers have found that having a sense of purpose in the workplace causes employees to be more engaged and less likely to shy away from responsibility, which leads to increased performance. Additionally, having a purpose at work leads to improved self-esteem as a result of development of a personal identity and increased professional dignity. Furthermore, research has indicated that finding meaning in one’s work is key to growth and achieving his or her true potential. Sharing a purpose with coworkers has additional benefits, including improved camaraderie, mentorship, and support. Your value in the work that you are doing together has the potential to significantly add to the quality of your relationship, and will also help you through any periods of difficulty or stress.',
		'“It’s not hard to make decisions once you know what your values are” --- Roy E. Disney.   Coworkers who share the same values and vision are more likely to have a deep sense of trust, admiration, and respect towards one another. Employees are motivated by their values and vision, which causes them to believe in the organization as a whole and align their values and goals with the organization’s. As a result, individuals put forth greater effort to achieving goals when their goals are in the service of something they believe in.  Additionally, coworkers who share values are more likely to go above and beyond in helping the company for the sake of their work and not for any particular reward. This willingness to put effort into an organization’s operations results from shared values across an organization and the associated positive outcomes are immensely beneficial. Your shared vision and similar values will help to sustain you, both in the work that you are doing and in your relationship with one another.',
		'“Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life” --- Confucius.   While you may still feel like your job is in fact work, enjoying what you do and enjoying the people you work with can take a significant burden out of the daily endeavor of showing up at your company. Enjoying work stems from finding the work itself intrinsically interesting and motivating, and has positive benefits including increases in positive affect, coping, and well being. In addition, work enjoyment has been linked to improved attitudes towards work, learning, performance, and adaptability. All of these positive benefits result from engagement and a sense of genuineness that in turn leads to enhanced effort and ultimately stronger relationships. Work enjoyment leads coworkers to engage in stronger interpersonal connections, have more interest in mentoring and helping others, and exhibit more creative thinking. Research has demonstrated that when employees feel positive about work, they are more likely to reach out to others, creating stronger information networks and improved workplace relationships. Additionally, a link has been found between organizational support and enjoyment of work, indicating that having strong relationships in the workplace leads individuals to more generally enjoy their work and to express feelings of appreciation and gratitude. Your enjoyment of your working relationship will serve as a tremendous strength, both for your relationship as a whole and for your entire organization.',
		'“The only way to do great work is to love what you do” ---Steve Jobs  Being part of a team that is motivated to do good work is crucial to work itself and the entire experience of working. There are many sources of motivation for work, including internal motivators like passion and enjoyment and external sources like incentives and rewards. Shared internal motivation increases effort and engagement, and in turn leads to improved performance and relationships in the workplace. In addition, external motivation stemming from incentives such as monetary rewards has been found to have wide-ranging benefits including increases in employee interest, performance, and goal attainment. Regardless of the source of their motivation, employees with drive are expected to have increased performance and productivity. Capitalizing on your motivation will help you to make significant contributions to your work and will help you get through difficult times of stress. Because this is a strength of yours, you can be there for each other to offer support and inspiration when either of you might need it. This strength is going to serve you well as you continue your work together.',
		'“Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter” --- Martin Luther King Jr.   The importance of being able to put words to what matters to you, and in turn having your message heard and valued cannot be overstated.  Having a voice in one’s organization is essential for performance and morale, as these outcomes suffer when people are unable to vocalize their opinions. Vocalizing problems and concerns makes leaders of organizations aware of issues occurring at all levels of the workplace, which allows them to possess accurate information about company performance as well as make timely and informed decisions. Additionally, feeling that your voice is valued increases your commitment to your organization, including feeling responsible for constructive change, having a sense of responsibility, and identifying with one’s team or work-group. Having a voice at work is also associated with having a caring climate characterized by prosocial behaviors like support and mentorship. Using your voice and feeling like a critical and respected team member indicates that you have several strengths within your organization and working relationship, which will serve you well in the future of your work.',
		'“It’s not the load that breaks you down, it’s the way you carry it” --- Lou Holtz.   Stress is an inevitable aspect of any job, the way that you work together to meet that stress can make all the difference in the impact that it has on you. Research has found that although stress has been linked to negative emotional and physical health outcomes both in work and home life, coworker support can act as a buffer and reduce these negative effects. Social support has been found to reduce job stress and lead to higher levels of job satisfaction in stressful work environments. Additionally, receiving adequate help and informational support from coworkers when stressed has been linked to overall job satisfaction. It has also been posited that having strong relationships with coworkers actually reduces stress as a result of emotional support as well as increased satisfaction with one’s workplace. When one has a well-structured team that provides both emotional support and practical assistance, employees are much less likely to be stressed and more likely to have high job satisfaction. Given all of that, your ability to work well together even in times of stress is a tremendous strength that will actually (hopefully) lead to feeling less stress in the long run.'
